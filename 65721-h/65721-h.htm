<p>THE KING OF FRANCE ENTERS THE CITY OF NAPLES IN TRIUMPH.--THE ATTACK
AND CAPTURE OF THE CASTEL NUOVO AND THE CASTEL DEL OVO.&mdash;OF THE EVENTS
THAT PASSED IN NAPLES.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">On</span> Sunday, the 22d day of February, in the year 1494, king Charles
dressed himself in his royal robes, and triumphantly entered the city
of Naples. Although he afterwards made another entry, as shall be more
fully detailed, he, however, showed himself this day the true king and
potent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> lord of Naples, and went thence to the castle of Capua.</p>

<p>As some of the partisans of king Alphonso still held the citadel of
Naples, the Castel Nuovo, and the Castel del Ovo, king Charles ordered
them to be instantly attacked, although one side of the citadel was
washed by the sea. He had his battering artillery pointed against the
Castel Nuovo; and the captains of the guard for the king were sir
Gabriel de Montfaucon, Jean de la Grange, and others of rank.</p>

<p>Not to prolong matters, the citadel was gained after a very severe
attack; and the Germans, Neapolitans, and Spaniards, of the party
adverse to the king of France, burnt the outworks and hastily retreated
to join their associates in the Castel Nuovo. In the citadel were found
the largest cannons that had ever been seen, with such quantities of
other things of an extraordinary appearance that it was more than eight
days before the place could be cleared, by employing numbers of people
and carts.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 25th day of February, the king, after hearing mass
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> church of the Annonciada went to dine with the lord de
Montpensier, and thence, accompanied by his lords, repaired to the
citadel to examine how it had been battered, and to consult on the
best means of conquering the Castel Nuovo. The next day the garrison
demanded a parley, on which the artillery ceased firing,&mdash;and the lord
Angilbert of Cleves, the lord of Ligny, the bailiff of Dijon, and the
great chamberlain to the queen advanced to confer with them. The first
demand of the garrison was, that the king would grant them a truce for
twenty-four hours, which was cheerfully acceded to: the next, that
they might, on the morrow, march away with arms and baggage, which was
refused.</p>

<p>On the twenty-four hours being expired, the artillery played more
fiercely than before,&mdash;and it was a pitiful sight to view the ruins of
this Castel Nuovo, which was exceedingly strong. The besieged fired
a piece of artillery against the church of the Franciscans of the
observantine order, which broke through the roof, but did not the least
mischief to crowds of per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>sons, of both sexes, then in the church. The
incessant firing of the batteries lasted from Thursday to the Monday
following,&mdash;and there were so many breaches, for the king was there
in person, that the garrison again demanded a cessation of arms for
another parley. The lord Angilbert of Cleves and the bailiff of Dijon,
who spoke German, met the deputies from the castle. They demanded
permission to march away in safety with their baggage, to receive
three months pay to serve the king, if it should be agreeable to him;
otherwise, to receive passports for them to go whither-soever they
pleased.</p>

<p>The cessation of arms was renewed from day to day, as the parley was
prolonged by the garrison until the 3d of March, in expectation of
being relieved by king Alphonso. But when they found all hopes of
relief vain, and that the batteries were about to recommence with more
violence than ever, they were forced to abandon themselves to the mercy
of the king, into whose hands they surrendered themselves. He allowed
them to keep their baggage; but all artillery, stores, and provisions,
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> to remain in the castle, which he immediately re-garrisoned with
his troops, and with able captains, for its defence.</p>

<p>During the king's stay at that pleasant place Poggio-Réalé, the
daughter of the duchess of Melfy<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, in company with her mother, came
thither, mounted on a superb courser of La Puglia, and throwing the
bridle on his neck, made him gallop four or five long courses; after
which she made him curvet and bound, as well as the most excellent
rider could have done, which pleased the king very much,&mdash;and he made
her a handsome present.</p>

<p>Monday, the 4th of March, the king had the Castel del Ovo besieged,
and strongly battered on the land side; the others were surrounded by
the sea. This day, the king heard mass at the carthusian convent, and
dined with the lord of Clerieux<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: he afterwards visited the siege
of the Castel del Ovo, of which the artillery had already destroyed
great part,&mdash;for the canoniers had performed their duty won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>derfully
well, insomuch that about five o'clock in the afternoon the garrison
demanded a parley. The king being there in person, consented to it, and
sent thither the lords de Foix and de Miolan, who having heard their
proposals, carried them to the king while at supper.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 5th of March, the king again returned to the siege,
after his dinner; and while he was in the trenches with his artillery,
the prince of Tarentum waited on him. The lord de Guise, the lord
de Ligny, the master of the household Brillac, had advanced to meet
the prince, and remained as hostages for his safe return after the
conference. The king and prince were both sumptuously dressed, and
conversed by themselves for some time, in a garden adjoining to the
park of artillery, to all appearance with great politeness. When the
conversation was ended, the king called to him the lord de Montpensier,
the lord de Foix, the lord de la Trimouille, the lord de Miolan,
the mareschal de Gie, and several others, with whom he talked for a
considerable time, surrounded by his guards. When it was over, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
prince took leave of the king, and returned to his galley, which was
anchored off the shore, attended by many of the french lords, according
to the king's orders. On his arrival at the shore, he took leave of
these lords, commending himself to the good graces of their king; and
when he had embarked in his galley they went back to relate to the king
all that had passed, and his praises of the reception he had had. On
this day the artillery did not play on either side.</p>

<p>Friday, the 6th of March, the king, having heard mass, went to dine
with the lord de Clerieux,&mdash;and this day many of the garrison (among
whom were several of the wounded) left the Castel del Ovo. The
Spaniards went to the prince of Tarentum, and the Germans surrendered
themselves to the king, having passports for the purpose. The lord de
Cressol, sir Gabriel de Montfaucon, by the king's command, entered the
castle with a body of men under arms, and archers, to take charge of
it, and the numberless stores within it.</p>

<p>Saturday, the 7th of March, the king went to examine the Castel del
Ovo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> then departed to lay siege to the opposite castle. Towards
evening, the prince of Tarentum paid another visit to the king, near
to the park of artillery,&mdash;and the lords de Guise and de Ligny were
hostages for his safe return. This conference was short, for it was
late; and when the prince returned to his galley the above lords
rejoined the king. It is worthy of remark, that on this day the prince
of Salernum, who had been, five years a fugitive from Naples, through
fear of king Alphonso, returned thither, and recovered a young son who
had been, by Alphonso, confined in prison,&mdash;for the cardinal of San
Pietro ad vincula had paid a very large sum for his ransom.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 8th of March, the king having heard mass, and dined,
went to amuse himself at the siege, and sent the governor of Paris,
and the esquire Galiot, to summon the garrison to surrender, otherwise
he would shortly batter the walls about their ears. They refused to
comply; and, in consequence, the batteries were played with such effect
that, on the Thursday following, the 12th, they knew not where to
shelter themselves,&mdash;and the go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>vernor was constrained to come from
the castle to speak with the king, then in the trenches. The governor,
bareheaded and on his knees, besought the king, with uplifted hands, to
grant a truce until the morrow, and to receive the garrison mercifully,
which was granted. The governor was a handsome, tall figure, with white
hairs; and, on having this answer, he returned by sea to the castle,
accompanied by the prince of Salernum and the mareschal de Gie, to
parley with the garrison in the castle. Shortly after, the captains
Claude de Rabaudanges and the lord de la Vernade were appointed
governors of this castle,&mdash;and nothing was taken out of it.</p>

<p>The king, on the following sunday, after hearing mass, returned to the
castle of Capua, and remained some days, to receive the homages of the
princes and princesses of the realm, together with those of the nobles
and inhabitants as well of Naples as of the Terra di Lavora, Calabria,
La Puglia, and of other parts subjected to the crown of Naples. He had
there establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ed his chancery, and courts of justice and finance,
with presidents like as in France. The president Guennay was the
chancellor, having the king's secretaries under him, with great and
smaller seals for all requisite acts. He ordered money to be coined of
gold and silver, and other metal; such as crowns, ducats, and various
pieces, both double and single, having the arms of France impressed on
one side, and on the reverse the arms of Sicily, quartered with the
small crosses of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The king now appointed many new officers for the city of Naples, and
in other towns,&mdash;namely, judges, masters of the mint, and of various
descriptions. During this interval, he visited the different churches
in Naples, and every thing worth seeing there and in its neighbourhood.
While thus employed, he had many very fine entertainments given him by
the nobility in Naples, and others,&mdash;but it would be tiresome to detail
them all.</p>

<p>News arrived on the Wednesday, that Gaieta was taken by the french
troops: in consequence of which, the king sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> seneschal of
Beaucaire on the morrow to take the government of it. During the
month of April, the king inspected his artillery, and that which had
been found in the castles of Naples: the greater part of the last was
transported to France. The lord d'Aubigny left Naples this month for
Calabria, accompanied by his men at arms and a large body of Germans.
The 15th of April, the king, after hearing mass in the church of the
Annonciada, was confessed, and then touched and cured great numbers
that were afflicted with the evil,&mdash;a disorder that abounded much all
over Italy,&mdash;when the spectators were greatly edified at the powers of
such an extraordinary gift. This day the lord Virgilio Orsini and the
count of Petilano waited on the king for the first time since they had
been made prisoners.</p>

<p>The next day, which was Maunday-Thursday, the 16th of April, the king
heard divine service in the church of St John, a handsome building,
and attended (as if in France) on thirteen poor persons, who were
washed and waited on at dinner, and presented with thirteen crowns.
The sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> was preached on that and the two following days by master
Pinelli, a doctor of divinity in the university of Paris.</p>

<p>On Easter-day, the 19th of April, the king was confessed in the church
of St Peter, adjoining to his lodgings, and then touched for the evil a
second time; after which he heard mass in the church of St John, and in
the evening a sermon by doctor Pinelli.&mdash;Wednesday, the 22d, the king
went to see the tiltings, the lists for which had been erected near
to a church founded by the Anjou-race of kings of Sicily, where were
many of the nobility and ladies of Italy. These justings lasted from
Wednesday until the first of May: the holders of them were Châtillon
and Bourdillon, and the assailants were very numerous,&mdash;and excellent
deeds of arms were done on each side.</p>

<p>On Sunday, being the feast of St Januarius, the king heard mass in the
cathedral or church of St Januarius, where many cardinals, bishops,
and prelates attended. The head of St Januarius was publicly displayed
to the king, and some of his blood in a glass bottle: it was congealed
like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> a stone, as the king proved by touching it with a small rod of
silver; but no sooner was it placed near to the head than it began
instantly to melt and become liquid, to the astonishment of many who
viewed this miracle.</p>

<p>The prelates of the church said, that by means of this miraculous head
and blood of St Januarius, they were made acquainted with the success
of their petitions to God; for when their prayers had been propitious,
the blood became liquid,&mdash;but when otherwise, it remained hard. They
were likewise by this means informed as to the dispositions of their
prince, and whether he was to reign over them or not, which seemed very
extraordinary.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 4th of May, the king sent Jean du Bois, Fontaines, and
the master of the household de Bresse, to make an inventory of all the
stores, and other effects, in the Castel del Ovo,&mdash;for there appeared
to be such quantities of provision, and of other things, that the
value seemed inestimable. During this time, the king visited several
places in the neighbourhood of Naples; such as the grotto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> which Virgil
had pierced with such subtile art through a high mountain on the
seashore of Naples, which is a wonderful thing, as there is no other
road but through this subterraneous passage, as all who have seen it
can testify. A little further on is the Solfaterra, where sulphur is
made,&mdash;and there are natural fires beneath the surface that are always
burning: the king saw them make sulphur. There are, likewise near,
many springs of hot water as well as of cold; and in a valley of this
mountain is a hole through which comes such an impetuous wind that it
supports in the air stones, and pieces of wood, that are thrown into
it,&mdash;and it is said that the heat is very great within this hole. The
king visited another remarkable spot where alum is made, and saw the
whole process. Near to this last place is a cavern having a deadly
quality; for whatever is thrown in perishes instantly, as was proved
before the king on an ass and cat, which, on being thrown in, were
suddenly killed<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. The king, hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>ing seen all that was most curious,
returned to Naples for the night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>KING CHARLES MAKES HIS PUBLIC ENTRY INTO NAPLES, AS KING OF THAT
COUNTRY AND MONARCH OF ALL ITALY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, the 12th of May, the king, having heard mass in the church of
the Annonciada, left Naples after dinner for Poggio-Réalé,&mdash;where all
the princes and nobles of France and Italy were assembled, to accompany
him in his public entry into Naples, as king of France, Sicily, and
Jerusalem. He was dressed in royal robes, and made a most splendid and
triumphant entry, and thenceforward was called Charles Cæsar Augustus.
In his right hand was the globe, and his sceptre in the left,&mdash;and his
mantle was of fine scarlet trimmed with ermine, having a deep fall-down
collar, ornamented with ermines' tails also, with a brilliant crown on
his head. The horse he rode was as grandly caparisoned as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to suit his state: and over his head was borne a splendid canopy by
the highest nobility of Naples, who were surrounded by the king's
valets richly dressed in cloth of gold: the provost of the household
with his archers on foot attended on him on each side. The seneschal
of Beaucaire represented the constable of Naples,&mdash;and the lord de
Montpensier preceded him, handsomely mounted, and dressed as viceroy
and lieutenant-general of Naples.</p>

<p>The prince of Salernum was present, together with the great lords of
France, of the blood royal, and knights-companions of the king's order;
such as, the lord de Bresse, the lord de Foix, the lord de Luxembourg,
the lord de Vendôme, and others without number, all dressed in mantles
like to what the king wore. In short, the entry was most magnificent;
and the nobility of Naples, with their ladies, presented to the king
their children of ten, twelve, and fifteen years of age, requesting of
him to make them knights, which he did with his own hand,&mdash;and it was a
splendid spectacle.</p>

<p>The prelates and clergy came out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> meet him in the richest copes,
bearing relics, and conducted him to the cathedral, where on the high
altar were displayed, as before, the head and blood of St Januarius. In
front of the altar, the king swore to protect his new subjects, and to
preserve them in their liberties and privileges, which gave universal
satisfaction,&mdash;and great rejoicings were made on this occasion, and
also for his happy arrival, and the great good he had promised them.</p>

<p>The king was, after this, conducted to his palace, where, during
several days, he received embassies from different parts of his
kingdom; such as Calabria, La Puglia, L'Abruzzo, to do homage, and to
inquire respecting the manner in which they were to be governed by
a viceroy when the king should be absent, as was natural for them.
On Monday, the 18th of May, the king ordered a grand supper to be
prepared at the Castel Nuovo, where he gave a sumptuous banquet, to
his princes and nobles, seated at two tables, in the great hall of
the castle, to which was an ascent by several stone steps. The grand
seneschal of Naples served the whole of the supper, superbly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> mounted,
and clothed in white, with abundance of trumpets and clarions sounding.
After supper, the king received the homage of all the lords, and then
returned to sleep at his palace.</p>

solemnity at the church of the Annonciada, dined at the palace; after
which, the nobility of Naples waited on him to take leave. They were
assembled in the great hall, where the king received them graciously,
and kindly bade them adieu! at the same time, he presented to them the
lord de Montpensier, as their viceroy and governor during his absence.
When this was done, the king departed from Naples, attended by a

<p>KING CHARLES RETURNS, FROM NAPLES TO FRANCE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> king, as I have said, left Naples on the 20th of May, and halted
at Aversa. On the 21st, he marched from Aversa to Capua. On the
morrow, he dined and slept at the bishop's palace in Sezza<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; and
on the Saturday, as he was about to enter Gaieta to refresh himself,
the castle fell down and obstructed the road, so that he returned to
Sezza,&mdash;but on the Sunday, when the damages had been repaired, he
proceeded and lay at Monte Cassino. Thence he passed to Ponte-corvo,
to Cyprienne, and to Fiorentino, a small city, then under an interdict
from pope Alexander, because the inhabitants had murdered and cut off
the arms of their bishop, who was a Spaniard, for having been obstinate
in supporting king Alphonso against the king of France. This latter
would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> been able to have heard mass that day, if he had not
before had full powers given him to order the celebration of the mass
in all places, according to his good pleasure.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 29th, the king advanced for the night to Valmontone,
wherein were many who hated the French, because they had destroyed and
burnt Monte-Fortino: nevertheless, he proceeded to Marina the next day,
and halted there till Sunday.</p>

<p>On Monday the first of June, the king re-entered Rome, on his return
to France, and was lodged in the palace of the cardinal de St Clement,
near to St Peter's. He was grandly accompanied by his nobles, gentlemen
pensioners, men at arms, cross-bowmen, Swiss and Germans; and because
pope Alexander was absent<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, he posted his men in different parts of
the town, to check any insolence of the Romans. Having done this, he
went to St Peter's, to return his thanksgivings to God. On Wednesday,
he left Rome, dined at Isola, and lay at Campanolle. Friday he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
advanced to Ronciglione, and the same day entered Viterbo with his
whole army, where he was as well received as before. He remained in
Viterbo until Whitsunday was passed, to perform his devotions, and
visit the body of St Rosa.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June, the king supped and lay in the town of Monte
Fiascone, celebrated for its muscadine wines,&mdash;and thence, continuing
his march through La Paille and other places, arrived at Sienna, the
inhabitants of which came out to welcome him, magnificently dressed,
and with the same ceremonies as at the first of his coming thither.</p>

<p>The king marched from Sienna on the 17th of June for Poggiobondi,
where he lay, and staid the following morning, on account of its
being the feast of the holy sacrament, and attended the procession to
high mass with great devotion. After dinner he advanced to Château
Florentin,&mdash;and on the morrow he dined at Campane, near to Florence;
but he did not enter Florence on his return, for, under pretence of
being in the french interest, the town of Pont-Velle had been taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Saturday, the 20th of June, the king entered Pisa, where he was
received with every honour and submission. He staid there two days,
and on the Tuesday following dined at Pommart, and slept at Lucca,
where, in return for his handsome reception, he took the town under
his protection. He marched through Pietra Santa, and arrived, on the
Saturday, at Sarsaigne<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, where he had intelligence of the junction
of the duke of Milan with the Venetians. For this reason, he would not
sleep at Villa Franca, but encamped his army on the other side of the
river, where he supped, and waited for the arrival of his artillery,
and the rear of his army.</p>

<p>The king left his camp, at Villa Franca, on the 30th of June, to hear
mass at a large monastery near to Pontremoli; for the Germans had burnt
that town, in revenge for the murders of some of their countrymen by
the inhabitants, on their march to Naples. After dinner, the king
encamped at the foot of the Appenines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> there remained until his
artillery had passed the mountains. The lord de la Trimouille and Jean
de la Grange were charged with this business,&mdash;and although there
were plenty of hands they had great difficulties, on account of the
rocks. On the 3d of July, and the following day, the king crossed the
Appenines, and passed through Verceil and Cassano, and encamped his
army near to Borgo de Taro, where he lay, under the security of strong
guards. Sunday, the 5th of July, the king heard mass in his camp,
and dined at Foronuovo<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, where he formed his plan for the order of
battle, with a main body, a van and reserve, and having the usual
guards established.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE BATTLE OF FORONUOVO, WHERE THE KING OF FRANCE GAINS A COMPLETE
VICTORY OVER THE CONFEDERATED PRINCES OF ITALY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">On</span> Monday the 6th of July, in the year 1495, the french army was
encamped adjoining to the valley of Taro, about two miles from
Foronuovo, and four from Parma. Thence marched that gallant prince,
Charles VIII. of the name, king of France, accompanied by those valiant
captains before mentioned, and about eight or nine thousand courageous
men at arms, to meet from fifty to sixty thousand Lombards, Venetians,
Estradiots<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and others, his enemies. The marquis of Mantua was
commander of the Venetians: count Galeas Sforza was the representative
of his brother, Ludovico duke of Milan, and the lord of Ferrara
commanded the rest of the traitors, in company with other captains.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The king was armed from head to foot in a manner becoming so great
a prince. Over his armour he wore a jacket, with short sleeves, of
a white and violet colour, besprinkled with crosses of Jerusalem.
His helmet was magnificently ornamented with feathers,&mdash;and he was
accoutred like a good man at arms, with sword, dagger, spear and
battle-axe. He was mounted on a powerful black horse, called Savoy,
whose caparison was of the same colours with the king's jacket, and
besprinkled with similar small crosses. The king was surrounded by very
able and trusty advisers to direct him, having under them about two
thousand men, who afterwards gave good proofs of their valour.</p>

<p>When the french army had been properly arranged, and the artillery
was ready, they began to advance toward the enemy in such wise as the
ground served them. The Italians not knowing in what division of the
army the king had posted himself, sent a herald, under pretence of
asking something from him,&mdash;and the herald, on his return, told them
the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> in which the king was accoutred. They now began to move,
and taking advantage of a favourable situation, discharged a heavy
piece of artillery at the van of the french, which wounded and killed
several, although it did not break their ranks, nor cause any great
confusion. A sharp cannonading followed; but the king's artillery
did great mischief to the enemy, and killed one of their principal
cannoniers, as was known from a trumpeter that was soon after made
prisoner. The king's artillery was so well served that the Italians
were forced to retreat, having noticed the excellent order in which the
French were formed.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to observe the cool and determined valour of the
gallant king, both in actions, and in speeches to those about his
person: 'How say you, my lords and friends? Are you not resolved to
serve me well to-day? and will you not live and die with me?' Then
having heard their answers, he continued, 'Be of good courage, and
not afraid; for although they be ten times our number,&mdash;which is the
case, as I know for certain,&mdash;yet we have justice on our side, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
which I put my confidence in God, that he will be pleased to give us
the victory over our enemies. I have also hopes that he will fight
this day on our side, and that, through his gracious favour, we shall
again triumph, as we have done throughout the whole of this expedition,
and return to France with honour to ourselves, through his merciful
kindness.' Such, or nearly similar, were the words with which this
valorous king consoled and encouraged all around him.</p>

<p>The enemy were much surprised at the good order of the French; and
to endeavour to break it, they sent a detachment of Estradiots, and
some Albanians, across a hill, to fall on the baggage. Those who had
the guard of it had been very negligent in not keeping themselves
in readiness to resist an attack, by reason of some dispute among
themselves, for which they suffered; but it was not much, as shall be
told hereafter,&mdash;and the army remained unbroken.</p>

<p>The Italians, seeing this, sent a herald to the king to demand a truce.
The king replied,&mdash;'If they wish for a truce, let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> meet me between
the two armies.' But he afterward sent to them, to say, that if they
would, through friendship, allow him and his army a free passage to
France, it was all he wanted, otherwise he would force his passage in
spite of them.</p>

<p>The Lombards and Venetians, hearing this message from the king's
herald, detained him, and resolved instantly to charge the French,
like madmen. They were particularly desirous to attack the division
where the king was, to put him to death,&mdash;but God was that day his
Protector. The advanced guard, perceiving the enemy thus hastily
marching, informed the king of their gaining the woods and bushes;
on which he crossed the bed of the Taro, and each army was in sight
of the other. In fact, the Italians were handsomely equipped and
mounted, and advanced with the appearance of a determined courage, as
they were far superior in numbers to the French. Their best men were
placed in front,&mdash;and the first onset was very severe on both sides.
As they had been informed by their herald how the king was dressed,
their chief attack was made on his divi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>sion, and with such success
that they advanced to his person; but he displayed great valour, and
was so heartily seconded by those near him that the enemies were
completely repulsed, with immense slaughter; even the boldest among
them attributed their highest honour to him who could fly the fastest;
for when they saw the day was lost, the best piece of all their armour
was the point of their spurs.</p>

<p>Only one man of rank was made prisoner on the side of the French,
namely, Matthew bastard of Bourbon, who had most valiantly defended
the king, and he was taken when pursuing the enemy up to their lines.
Not more than nine or ten french gentlemen were killed, although
their enemies were ten to one against them, the greater part of whom
saved themselves by flight. This proves, beyond a doubt, that Divine
Providence assisted the French, and gave them the victory over their
disloyal enemies, who were conquered in so very short a space of time.
The king remained the whole of the day armed and on horseback, and
until the whole of his army had retired within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> their camp. Thither
came ambassadors to him from the Italians, to demand the prisoners; but
they were answered, that they should not be restored,&mdash;which astonished
them greatly, as they feared that some of their first nobility had been
either killed or made prisoners.</p>

<p>The king and his nobles, in sign of triumph and victory, supped and
lay on the field of battle,&mdash;where they ate and drank what they could
find, and as it pleased God, to whom they gave their most humble
thanksgivings and praises for their success, as indeed they were
bounden to do.</p>

<p>THE KING DECAMPS FROM FORONUOVO, TO RETURN TO FRANCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morrow of the battle of Foronuovo, the 7th of July, the king,
after hearing early mass, decamped from before Foronuovo, and posted
his army on an elevated situation called Magdelan, about half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> a
french league from his late camp, where he remained the whole day.
The commanders of the artillery made such diligence in bringing up
the cannon that they were placed round the king, as was usual in such
cases. The king marched away, on the Wednesday, with his army and
artillery, and repassed several towns wherein he had halted on his
advance to Naples, notwithstanding the attempts of the enemy to prevent
it. He came at length to Novara, and delivered the duke of Orleans, who
had been shut up in that town, with a party of his men, by the traitor
Ludovico of Milan. Thence the king proceeded to Asti and to Vercelli,
where the duke of Orleans came to meet him. The king received him with
much friendship, and they supped together.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 2d of October in this year, the lord de Vendôme died
in the town of Vercelli. His death was much lamented by the king
and his nobles, for he was a notable prince. The following Tuesday,
the king had a funeral service performed with much solemnity in
the cathedral-church dedicated to St Euse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>bius, where great grief
was manifested by all the assistants; and afterward his body was
transported to France, to be interred among his ancestors.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 7th of October, the bishop of Sion arrived at
Vercelli, with a body of Swiss, horse and foot, and others from the
german allies of the king, for his better security. The king thanked
the bishop for his friendship, and grandly feasted him and the troops
he had brought.</p>

<p>The next day, ambassadors came to the king from Ludovico of Milan and
the Venetians, and earnestly demanded a treaty, having witnessed the
strength of the king, and the enterprising courage of his troops,&mdash;when
a treaty was agreed to, on much better terms than they deserved.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 10th of October, the king heard mass in the church
of the Cordeliers in Vercelli, adjoining his lodgings; and after his
dinner, he proceeded to Trino, where he halted until the 15th of
October, when he went to Crescentino, and from this place, by many
days march, arrived at Grenoble, passing through the following towns;
Sil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>lans, Sessia<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, Turin, Quiers, Rivoli, Suza, Briançon, Nôtre
Dame d'Embrun, Savines, Saint Eusebe, La Meure<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and Tault near to
Grenoble. He arrived at Grenoble about vespers, on the 27th of October;
and all ranks of people went out in procession, and made another public
entry for him on his return from the campaign of Italy.</p>

<p>The king, being unwell, remained in Grenoble until the 3d of
November, when he set out for Lyon, passing through the towns of St
Rambert, where he staid some days, Sillans, La Côte St André, and
Chatonay,&mdash;from which last place he advanced nearer to Lyon, where he
slept.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 7th of November, having dined at Venisseu, he
proceeded to Lyon, whence all the churchmen came out in grand
procession, dressed in their robes, and bearing relics, to meet and
welcome him on his return from Italy. He made a public entry into Lyon,
as king of Jerusalem, Naples, and Sicily, attended by all the municipal
officers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> persons of rank in that town, handsomely dressed. He
was conducted triumphantly through the streets, accompanied by the
nobles and captains, who were looked at with pleasure in consequence
of the noble victory they had gained over such superior numbers. The
streets and squares were hung with tapestries: bonfires and mysteries
were exhibited in all the open spaces through which the king passed,
in his way to the archbishop's palace, that had been prepared for his
lodgings. Here the queen and the duchess of Bourbon his sister were
waiting, with many noble ladies and damsels, impatient to receive him;
and indeed he was deserving of such eagerness.</p>

<p>The king held most sumptuous justs at three different places in Lyon:
at La Grenette in front of the convent of Cordeliers, in the Juerie,
and before the palace: at all of them, he was foremost to offer
himself, and performed many gallant feats with lance and sword, on
horseback and on foot, as did several others of the french lords. In
memory of these justs, three stone columns were erected,&mdash;and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> this
day there exist the latin verses that were inscribed on them, for king
Charles was the principal tenant of the lists.</p>

<p>Prior to the expedition to Naples, the king had the body of the
seraphic doctor, St Bonaventure, raised with great pomp from his tomb
in the church of the Cordeliers,&mdash;and the duke and duchess of Bourbon
had his shrine afterward covered with plates of silver. The king, at
the same time, founded the convent of the Cordeliers of the Observance
in the city of Lyon, which is become a place of much devotion.</p>

<p>When the king had staid some days in Lyon, he resolved to pursue his
journey, to pay his devotions at the abbey of St Denis, and return
thence to Amboise,&mdash;which he did, as shall be hereafter related.</p>

<p>In the year 1496, the son of the king of Spain died,&mdash;and the same year
died the duke of Savoy, who was said, by those lately returned from
Italy, to have poisoned the whole country of Piedmont.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE KING OF FRANCE GOES TO ST DENIS.&mdash;HE RETURNS TO AMBOISE, AND THERE
SUDDENLY DIES, OF A FIT OF APOPLEXY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">When</span> king Charles had made some stay in Lyon, and had witnessed the
tilts and tournaments that had been performed at Moulins, in the
Bourbonnois, he proceeded to the abbey of St Denis, to accomplish the
vow of pilgrimage he had made, and to offer up his thanksgivings to God
for the brilliant victories he had obtained over his enemies, and for
the successful issue of his expedition to Naples. He went likewise to
St Denis, to replace the blessed bodies of the holy martyrs, who repose
there, that had been taken down from their niches when the king set out
on his italian expedition.</p>

<p>It is an ancient and praiseworthy custom, that when the most Christian
kings of France undertake any foreign expedition in person, they
supplicate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> aid and intercession of the glorious martyr St Denis,
and his companions Saint Rusticus and Saint Eleutherus. The shrines of
these saints are, in consequence, taken down from their niches on the
king's quitting his kingdom, and deposited in a private part of the
church. These holy bodies, thus deposited, cannot be replaced in their
former situations until the king shall return to St Denis from his
foreign expedition, whether it had been for conquest or pleasure.</p>

<p>King Charles, therefore, having been victorious throughout Italy,
followed the pious custom of his ancestors the kings of France. He
made a devout pilgrimage, to St Denis,&mdash;and the shrines of the martyrs
were, by him, replaced in their several niches, in the presence of
the great barons of France. The king would neither pass nor repass
through Paris on this pilgrimage, for reasons that moved him so to do,
but which I omit, to avoid prolixity. For this cause, when he left St
Denis, he took his road through St Antoine des Champs, thence over Le
Pont-de-Chalen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>ton<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and through Beauce, strait to the castle of
Amboise, where he found the queen and many lords and ladies of his
noble blood. He was received there by the inhabitants with the utmost
joy and honour.</p>

<p>He had not been long at Amboise before he heard of the treachery of the
Neapolitans, and the death of the noble Gilbert lord of Montpensier.
The remaining captains, unable to support themselves in Naples after
his loss, returned home as well as they could; for those traitors of
Lombardy and Naples had suddenly risen in rebellion,&mdash;and they could
not possibly receive succours in time from France, had they attempted
to hold out against them, from the great distance.</p>

<p>King Charles made preparations to avenge himself on them for their
treachery and infidelity,&mdash;but he had over-exerted himself in his late
expedition. His constitution, which was naturally feeble, became daily
worse: whence it happened, that as he was walking one day in a gallery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of the castle of Amboise with the queen, and amusing himself by looking
at some tennis-players, he was suddenly seized with a fit, and died
shortly after, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, and in the month
of April in the year 1497. May God have mercy on his soul!</p>

<p>OF THE FUNERAL SERVICES PERFORMED FOR KING CHARLES VIII. OF FRANCE, AT
AMBOISE, PARIS, AND ST DENIS.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">After</span> the decease of king Charles VIII. whose soul may God pardon! a
very solemn funeral service was performed at Amboise, in the church of
St Florent, by the reverend cardinal the lord John Peraule, assisted
by many prelates, great lords, and other persons. There were immense
numbers of tapers and torches, and great alms were distributed. When
this service was over, the king's heart was carried for interment to
the church of Nôtre Dame de Clery, near to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> his late father.
The body, with the representation of his figure over it, was borne
in sorrowful pomp to the church of our Lady in the fields, in the
suburbs of Paris, where it was watched all night by some of his most
confidential friends.</p>

<p>On the morrow morning, a grand procession came out of Paris, consisting
of all the clergy with their crosses, the four orders of mendicant
friars, the members of the court of parliament and of the other
courts of justice, the provosts, sheriffs, and inhabitants dressed
in mourning, to the church of our Lady in the Fields,&mdash;where were
waiting the great lords, officers, pages of honour, and others, to the
number of more than seven thousand persons, clad in mourning, with
hoods,&mdash;and, according to the usual ceremony, conducted the body to
the cathedral-church of our Lady in Paris. There were four hundred
torches, ornamented with escutcheons of three flowers de luce, carried
by four hundred poor men, dressed in black cloaks and hoods. A solemn
funeral service was performed in the church of Nôtre Dame; after which,
the body was car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ried with the same ceremonies through Paris to the
abbey of St Denis, where another service was solemnly performed for the
deceased, and presents of money given to all the assistants in making
the offerings at the mass, and great alms distributed to the poor.</p>

<p>When the accustomed ceremonies had been finished, the body of king
Charles was interred in the sepulchre that had been prepared for him;
after which there was a grand dinner given to all the assistants in
honour of the late king, to whose soul may God graciously grant his
pardon! Amen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OF KING LOUIS THE TWELFTH.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 23d of May, in the year 1498, Louis duke of Orleans, son to the
late duke Charles, was consecrated king of France, in the same manner
as his predecessors had been, in the cathedral of Rheims. He was the
twelfth who had borne the name of Louis, and the fifty-fifth king of
France.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>At this ceremony at Rheims were the twelve peers of France, or their
substitutes. For the duke of Burgundy appeared the duke of Alençon; for
the duke of Normandy, the duke of Lorraine; for the duke of Guienne,
the duke of Bourbon; for the earl of Flanders, the lord de Ravenstein;
for the earl of Champagne, the lord Angillebert of Cleves; for the earl
of Toulouse, the lord of Foix. Almost the whole of the french nobility
were present at the ceremony, which was solemnized in the usual mode to
that of former kings, by the cardinal of St Malo, archbishop of Rheims.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the king made knights of his order of St Michael
the lord de Taillebourg, the lord des Pierres, lord de la Gruture, the
lord de Clerieux. He created also knights to the amount of four score;
among whom were the lord de Myolans, sir Claude de Mont-l'Or lord of
Château-neuf, de Salazuit, and others, too numerous to name. When these
things were done, the king ordered preparations for his entry into
Paris.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, the king was crowned in the church of St Denis,
after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> the manner of his predecessors, kings of France. On the morrow
he made a triumphant entry into Paris, and supped at the palace. When
all these solemnities were ended, each person withdrew to different
places, as ordered by the king. The first who made any opposition to
him was the lord de Vergy,&mdash;but the war was soon ended in Burgundy.</p>

<p>The duke de Valentinois, said to be the son of pope Alexander VII.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
arrived at Lyon on the 18th of October, and made his public entry into
that city. The king had given him the county of Valentinois<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,&mdash;and
he was now come to France to conclude his marriage with the daughter of
the lord d'Albret. This duke was also a cardinal; but he had left that
dignity behind him, and appeared in secular clothes with the utmost
pomp and grandeur.</p>

<p>The 2d and 3d of December, the wind was so high at Lyon that the
greatest alarm was caused by it; and the custo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>dium, in which the hosts
were kept, on the high altar, in the church of the Cordeliers, was
burst open, owing to a broken pane in the window, and the sacred wafers
blown all about the church, to the great scandal of devout persons. It
happened somewhat before eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>This year, the king gave the princess Jane of France the duchy
of Berry; and, for the benefit of the realm, he espoused, by a
dispensation from pope Alexander VII. the widowed queen of France, Anne
of Brittany,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which was of the greatest public utility.</p>

<p>In the course of this year 1499, the head of St Bonaventure was
deposited, in a very rich shrine of silver, in the church of the
Cordeliers at Lyon,&mdash;and a most solemn procession was made on the
occasion by the friars of the convent. On the 10th of June, in this
year, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> king made his public entry into Lyon, which was very
magnificent. The streets were hung with tapestries,&mdash;and many fine
mysteries were represented in the squares. He was very anxious to
recover possession of the Milanese, and had sent thither a large
army, which, within fifteen days, reconquered Milan, on the 4th of
September. Duke Ludovico was in the town, and narrowly escaped being
taken, by quitting the place in disguise. The town of Alexandria della
Paglia<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, having shown much hatred to the French, was plundered, and
the greater part of it destroyed.</p>

<p>When the king heard of the capture of Milan, he left Lyon, giving
orders to the lord de Bersac to destroy all the benches and awnings
before the doors in that city. He made his public entry into Milan, and
regulated its government.</p>

<p>On the Friday before All-souls-day, in this year, the bridge of Nôtre
Dame, at Paris, fell down, which was a heavy loss;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> and the king sent
thither John de Doyac to superintend the immediate construction of
another.</p>

<p>The year 1500 was a grand year of jubilee at Rome, celebrated by pope
Alexander VII. and attended by great numbers. There would have been
more, if, on the 3d of January, duke Ludovico Sforza had not, in
person, regained Milan, by the aid of a considerable body of Germans.
He won the town through the treason of the inhabitants, who surrendered
themselves to him; but the French fought valiantly, and kept possession
of the castle, whence they battered the town.</p>

<p>Several Frenchmen, going to the jubilee at Rome, were murdered at the
inns on the road,&mdash;which being discovered, justice was done on the
perpetrators by burning their houses, with their inhabitants, to serve
for examples to all others. The duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, gave a
ducat to every one who brought him the head of a Frenchman. The count
Gayache and his wife now came to France; he was brother to the late
Galeas Visconti.</p>

<p>On the 19th of March in this year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> the queen of France made a second
public entry into Lyon, the streets being hung with tapestry, and
several beautiful mysteries represented. About eight days after, a
number of prisoners of war were brought before the king, at Lyon, for
having broken their oaths, at which the public greatly murmured.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">On</span> Thursday before Palm-Sunday, the French in Italy acted with such
vigour that duke Ludovico fled from Novara with one hundred horse,
abandoning his army and artillery in that town. When the french
captains approached, a burgundian leader, called the captain of the
Yotiers, came out of Novara and surrendered himself and men to them.
The bailiff of Dijon went into Novara to practise with the Swiss in the
pay of the duke of Milan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> (about four thousand in all), who only asked
for payment of what was due to them. In regard to the Lansquenets, they
knew not how to act; for the Swiss in the king's service would not show
them any mercy, although their captains did all they could that matters
might be settled without effusion of blood.</p>

<p>There were in Novara twenty thousand combatants; eight thousand
Lansquenets, four thousand Swiss, eight hundred Burgundians, and the
rest Lombards. In addition to these, a reinforcement of fifteen hundred
men were on their march to join them, and within a mile of Vercelli,
not including those in Vigeue.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after, Ludovico returned and marched his army out of Novara,
and encamped them near to the French; but God, knowing the usurpation
and wickedness of Ludovico, inspired the French with courage to defend
themselves, when attacked by him. Notwithstanding the duke of Milan
thought himself certain of destroying the French, the matter ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
without blood being spilt, and without a battle. It was said, that the
Lansquenets, refused to fight against their countrymen; and likewise,
that the duke had not paid his men their arrears, which made them
unwilling to serve him. On the other hand, the French were determined
on battle; but when they marched to charge the milanese army, it
surrendered to them without striking a blow.</p>

<p>The duke of Milan, observing this, disguised himself in the frock of
a cordelier monk, and, by mixing with his men, thought to escape;
but the lord de Ligny and the lord de la Trimouille made such good
arrangements with their army, it was impossible; for they ordered
the whole of the milanese force to pass under the pikes, so that the
duke was discovered, made prisoner, and put under the guard of the
French in Novara, which place had thrown open its gates. The lord
Jean Jacques<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was present at this conquest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> for he had always
been faithful to the king. The duke had in his pay an astrologer or
necromancer, in whom he put great confidence; but his astrology was of
no avail to prevent him being made prisoner.</p>

<p>According to agreements entered into with the milanese army, they were
allowed to depart in safety with their arms and baggage,&mdash;but the
duke and his artillery remained with the French. The lord-cardinal of
Amboise was then at Vercelli, and vowed the king under the protection
of our Lady des bonnes nouvelles.</p>

<p>Intelligence of this success came to the king at Lyon, the vigil of
Palm-Sunday, which rejoiced him exceedingly; and bonfires were made in
the streets, for joy that the French had been victorious. Immediately
after, news was brought that the duke of Milan was a prisoner, which
caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> the rejoicings to be repeated by all ranks of persons in Lyon.
The children of the duke were sent into Germany.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE CARDINAL ASCANIUS, BROTHER TO THE DUKE OF MILAN, IS TAKEN
PRISONER, AND CARRIED TO FRANCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> cardinal Ascanius, brother to the duke of Milan, was in that city
when he heard of the duke being a prisoner: he instantly departed
thence, with six hundred horse and some artillery, accompanied by the
higher nobility of Milan. He had also with him a considerable body of
Estradiots; and the commander of the whole was count John, brother to
the marquis of Mantua, who intended to march for the Bolognese,&mdash;but
it was said, that he was met by a venetian captain, of the name of
Soucin Bienson<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, with a body of troops, who at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>tacked the cardinal.
At this unexpected onset, the cardinal cried out, 'Qui vive?' and was
answered, 'St Mark and France!' The battle lasted four hours,&mdash;and the
venetian captain was severely wounded, with many of his men,&mdash;but when
the cardinal, who was in armour, saw the fortune of the day was against
him, he fled to a castle called Rivoli, which was immediately besieged
by the Venetian.</p>

<p>To make short of this matter,&mdash;the cardinal lost many of his men, and
the brother to the marquis of Mantua was ransomed. With this venetian
captain was another called Charles des Ursins. A milanese captain, of
the name of Badin, was made prisoner, with the abbot of Senselles,
and four viscounts,&mdash;and upwards of a hundred thousand ducats were
taken, without including the baggage. The cardinal, astonished to find
himself besieged in this castle without provision or money, entreated
the captain to ransom him, which he refused,&mdash;so that he surrendered
himself on the sole conditions of having his life spared, and of being
given up to the king of France.</p>

<p>The captain would have carried him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> prisoner to Venice,&mdash;but the
seneschal of Beaucaire, the lord de Montoison, and the chief justice
of Provence, who had gone thither to receive the cardinal, prevented
it. The Venetians also, knowing that the cardinal was an enemy to the
king, that he had been taken on the king's territories near Piacenza,
and wishing likewise to be on good terms with France, had the cardinal
delivered into the hands of the before-named persons.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Milan, on their duke and his brother the cardinal
being made prisoners, opened a negotiation, for the surrender of their
town, with the cardinal of Amboise, lieutenant for the king.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE INHABITANTS OF MILAN ARE BRIBED INTO SUBJECTION.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 17th of April, which was Good Friday, in this same year,
the inhabitants of Milan, acknowledging the great crimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> they had
committed against the king of France, their duke, most humbly besought
the reverend father in God the lord George d'Amboise, cardinal-priest
of the apostolical see, lieutenant-general for the said king, that
he would be pleased (after having granted some small sums for their
relief, to assist them in paying their fine, and also to save them
from the pillage and destruction which the army was ready to inflict
on them) to come to the duke's palace in the city of Milan to receive
their submissions, which they were determined to make publicly in
acknowledgment of their misconduct, and to entreat the clemency of the
king, on payment of such a fine as their means would admit of.</p>

<p>This reverend cardinal acceded to their request, and came to the palace
called La Court-vieille, whither arrived in procession all the nobles,
burghers, tradesmen and inhabitants, preceded by little children
dressed in white linen, and bareheaded, having a large crucifix, and
the great banner of our Lady, borne before them.</p>

<p>The lord-cardinal being seated on the throne prepared for him in the
great court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> of this palace, and surrounded by many of the king's
counsellors and captains, master Michael Touse, doctor of laws, and
town-advocate, ascended a rostrum that had been there erected, and made
the following harangue:</p>

<p>'Unworthy as I am to ascend this rostrum, my most reverend and most
illustrious lord-cardinal, I am very anxious to have it remembered,
and thus publicly to express the complete submission and devotion
my countrymen, the people of Milan, as well as myself, feel toward
our sovereign lord and duke, the most Christian king of France;
and although I know my own incapacity to express their wishes,
notwithstanding my earnest desire so to do, yet, as a good citizen, I
could not refuse their requests to undertake it,&mdash;and I will accomplish
it to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>'Among all the cities and towns of Italy, Milan, without doubt, must
be considered as the principal, when governed with justice by an
upright lord, as all good and loyal citizens have desired. Since God
the Creator, has been pleased to place them in the hands of the most
Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> king, their legitimate lord, they cannot wish for a better
nor a more powerful prince: their duty is to persevere in the fidelity
and loyalty which they have sworn to him when he received them with
such benignity and humanity. It may be said, that he had reintegrated
the citizens to their country, and their country to the founder; for
the French had founded and built the city of Milan,&mdash;and the country,
to this day, retains the name of Gallia Cisalpina. But, alas! we
have sadly displayed the instability of our tempers, and committed
the crimes of treason and rebellion without any reason for so doing;
for neither the king our lord nor the deputies he sent to govern us,
have done any things that ought to have displeased us, or make us
discontented. In regard to our lord himself, we have always found him
full of humanity, affection, and clemency; and in regard to the lord de
Luson, who had been appointed our chief justice, we cannot accuse him
of any improper acts,&mdash;for he ever received us kindly, and heard our
complaints attentively, doing justice to all parties, like as a good
father would to his children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>'In like manner, the lord Jean Jacques, who has ruled us without
distinction of persons, or the smallest partiality, punishing rather
his own people than ours, just as those excellent Romans, Brutus and
Torquatus, put to death their children for the good of their country.
He also has afforded us all necessary support. The lord-bishop of Como
and others of the family of Trivulce have acted in a similar kind
manner to us. We feel the more beholden to the lord Jean Jacques,
because knowing, as he did, the wicked intentions of many of the chief
exciters to the late rebellion, he attempted to gain them over from
their intentions by gratuities and honours, rather than dip his hands
in the blood of his countrymen. He preferred also retiring into the
castle to destroying the town by fire and sword, as perhaps strict duty
would have forced him to,&mdash;and from thence he departed, to return with
so much the greater glory. The preservation of the town from ruin is
solely owing to his prudent conduct: a superior victory to any achieved
by arms, seeing that Ludovico Sforza and almost all the king's enemies
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> become prisoners. The cardinal Ascanius and others attached to his
party were, by God's merciful providence, induced to leave the town,
when they might otherwise have injured it by obstinately holding out
against the troops of our legitimate lord. The inhabitants, therefore,
are greatly indebted to God and the king, who has kindly overlooked
their faults, and not punished them according to their deserts.</p>

<p>'To check the fury of his victorious army, the king has been pleased to
send you, my lord cardinal, hither, with full powers to act according
to your discretion; and this you have done with such prudence that you
have saved the town to the king,&mdash;for which we, our children, and our
successors, shall be ever beholden to you.</p>

<p>'We also thank my aforesaid lord the bishop of Como for his good
recommendations of us to you, and for the means he has taken for the
preservation of his country.</p>

<p>'Since, most reverend father in God, you have been pleased, out of your
bounty and clemency, following the kind will of our lord the king, to
grant to us, the inhabitants of Milan, this public audience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> they have
commissioned me to make, in their name, the following requests.</p>

<p>'In the first place, that it may be your good pleasure, when you
shall return to the king, to recommend us most humbly to his good
graces,&mdash;and to assure his majesty that the people of Milan will never
again rise in rebellion to his power and authority. They somewhat
resemble St Peter, who, having denied God the Redeemer, had afterwards
such grief for his sin that he was more ardent and determined in his
service than ever, continually supplicating mercy for his crime. In
like manner, most reverend father in God, and in the name of the king
our lord, do I, on my bended knees, for myself, the nobles, burghers,
and the inhabitants of Milan, beseech you to pardon the rebellion
perpetrated by us, which was contrary to the usual custom of the
Milanese, celebrated for their fidelity and loyalty.</p>

<p>'Secondly, most reverend father, in respect to the expenses the king
our lord has been put to in countermanding the troops sent hither to
punish us for our ill conduct, we have promised to pay the sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> of
three hundred thousand crowns: fifty thousand on the 12th of this
month, fifty thousand on the 1st day of May, and the remaining two
hundred thousand at his pleasure. We beseech you to intercede for us
to his majesty, that he would be graciously inclined to remit payment
of the balance of the two hundred thousand crowns,&mdash;for it will be
impossible to raise so large a sum without totally ruining the town.
Its whole wealth consists in merchandize, and in cloths of silk and
woollen,&mdash;and should so large a sum be withdrawn from trade, all these
works must stop, to the utter ruin of the city and duchy of Milan,
which depends so much upon it. The duty of a king is to enrich and not
impoverish his subjects.</p>

<p>'Thirdly, we most humbly supplicate, that you would dismiss all the men
at arms from the duchy as speedily as possible, that the fruits of the
coming harvest may be preserved for the use of our lord's subjects.</p>

<p>'Fourthly, we beseech you, that all persons may be restored to the
offices they before enjoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>'And, lastly, that since, out of your great mercy and wisdom, you
have been pleased to separate the principal instigators of the late
rebellion from the more peaceable inhabitants of the town,&mdash;and that,
through the mercy of God, the cardinal Ascanius and the chiefs of that
party are now, for the welfare of the country, detained prisoners,&mdash;we
beseech you to use your interest with the king our lord, that such
provisions be made to prevent them henceforth from troubling the city
and duchy, as they have lately done, and put us again in danger of
losing our lives and fortunes, whence we have been relieved by the
merciful bounty of the king our lord.</p>

<p>'We assure you, most reverend father in God, and most noble lord, that
we are determined to remain faithful to our sovereign prince in body
and soul; and, by granting us our requests, you will never again hear
of any disturbances or factions in this town,&mdash;for the inhabitants
will, henceforward, be united in his service, as experience shall
prove. We have full confidence that your benignant goodness will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> do
every thing, in regard to us, becoming the race whence you descend,
which will be agreeable to God, and worthy to be engraved on marble,
as a perpetual memorial of your wisdom, and to the glory of your name:
all of which I and the people of Milan now assembled here, again on our
bended knees, beseech you to grant.'</p>

<p>Master Michael having finished his harangue, the lord-cardinal of
Amboise consulted the marshal of Trivulce, the bishop of Luson<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>,
chancellor of Milan, the lord de Neufchatel, and others of the king's
counsellors, and ordered master Michael Ris, doctor of civil and canon
law, and counsellor to the king in his court of parliament of Burgundy,
and in the senate of Milan, to make a reply, which he did in manner
following.</p>

<p>'Misertus est Dominus super Ninevem civitatem; eo quod pænitentiam egit
in cinere et cilicio.' My lords and gentlemen of the Milanese, the
very reverend father in God and most noble cardinal here present, as
lieutenant general for the king <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>in this duchy, has more attentively
listened to your humble propositions and requests than your demerits
deserved. That his bounty and mercy may be more manifest, he has
ordered me to lay before you your great and inexcusable rebellion,
which his excellency would willingly have done himself could he have
addressed you in your own language. I am, therefore, employed to do it
by his command. I must, therefore, remind you, that on the day when
you swore fidelity to the most Christian king, I then addressed you by
his orders, and exhorted you to remain firm in your loyalty to him,
whence you would derive great honour, and by acting contrary inevitable
evils and disgrace would follow. I am now commanded by the most noble
lord-cardinal, here present, to explain your great disloyalty and
infidelity, that the exceeding clemency and pity of the king, our lord,
may be the more apparent.</p>

<p>'Your crimes and your demerits are so enormous, O Milanese! that no
punishments can be adequate to them,&mdash;and they are deserving of a
similar punishment from the king as the Romans inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> upon the
Samiens, as related to us by historians: 'Ita ruinas urbis diruerunt ut
hodie Samus in ipsa Samo requiratur.' Or one equal to what Archila<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
king of the Goths inflicted on the Romans, whose marks are now visible
on the walls and buildings of Rome. Or what Alexander did to the
Thebans. It may be seen in numerous histories, that for much smaller
crimes, Charles the great, king of France, and the emperor Frederick I.
punished most severely this city of Milan.</p>

<p>'To make your ingratitude more public, you have allowed that the most
Christian king is your true and legitimate lord, to whom you owe love
and obedience, according to the laws of God and man; for the wise
regulation of the Spartans says, 'Populum in obsequia principum,
principes ad justitiam imperatorum infirmabit.' In addition to the most
Christian king being your natural and lawful lord, he has conferred
upon you numberless benefits: he came in person to deliver you from
slavery,&mdash;not out of a disorderly ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> to gain kingdoms, but
from the pity he felt for you as subjects of duke John Galeazzo, your
first duke, whose most excellent daughter, the princess Valentina, was
his grandmother. He recalled Justice to your country, which had been
banished thence. He secured to you your lives and properties, which
before no one could call his own. He allowed you the liberty to marry
your children as you should please, which before this could not be
done; for a father could not marry a daughter, nor a mother a sister,
but according to the will and appetite of the lord. Offices which were
temporary he made perpetual. He abolished all pillories, concussions,
and exactions.</p>

<p>'Besides these and numberless other benefits that he showered upon you,
you were bounden by your oaths of allegiance to be faithful unto him:
nevertheless, many of you, even when taking these oaths, were plotting
to deceive him. All of you, ye Milanese! forgetful of the salvation
of your souls and honour, and regardless of the danger into which you
threw your wives, your children, and your town, have con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>spired against
your true lord in favour of a tyrant, quitting the first of kings in
Christendom for a mean fellow of low birth,&mdash;a most potent prince for
one as poor in courage as in wealth and friends. Had I the powers of
language to display the extent of such a crime, I should be incapable
to do it under two days; but your own consciences will make you more
sensible of it than I can,&mdash;and you may apply to yourselves what is
written, 'Populus dure cervicis,' when you committed that base act of
recalling your Ludovico in opposition to your true lord.</p>

<p>'What was the consequence? Did he not instantly seize all the effects
of private persons, and not only their wealth but even the crosses,
chalices, and jewels from the churches? What was said of Cambyses, king
of Persia, may be said of him, 'Difficile enim erat ut parceret suis,
qui contempta religione grassatus etiam in Deos fuerat.' Although from
so great a crime many may attempt to exculpate themselves, yet I do
not see how they can well do so, for it would have been easy at first
to have resisted such trea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>son: nor can one in Milan excuse himself
for the joyous reception given to Ludovico, as if he had been a god
descended from heaven on earth. The people of Milan assisted the lord
Ludovico with money and men. Feasts and entertainments were every where
displayed to welcome his arrival, and for his short-lived victories
when he gained Novara.</p>

<p>'Observe now, O Milanese! how strongly the justice of God, the Creator,
has been made manifest, and the great power that it has pleased Him to
invest the king our lord with: for when you thought that you had done
every thing by gaining Novara, at that moment you lost the whole, and
your idol, the lord Ludovico, carried away a prisoner,&mdash;so that what
was said of the Persians may be applied to him, 'Servit alteri cui
nuper mediolanum serviebat.'</p>

<p>'O Milanese! notwithstanding your enormous offences, the great fountain
of mercy of our good king has not been dried up by your ingratitude
to him: and the uncommon benignity of his lieutenant general, my lord
cardinal, has been fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> shown to you, from his respect and reverence
to this day, on which it pleased our Lord to suffer an ignominious
death on the cross for our salvation. He, in the king's name, pardons
your lives, your honours, and your property, exhorting you, at the same
time, to be more careful, henceforward, not only to avoid committing
similar offences but to avoid even the being suspected of them: for
should you ever relapse again into rebellion, you will be punished
with such severity the remembrance thereof shall endure to the latest
ages of the world. By acting as loyal subjects towards your lord, your
town and country will be daily improved, and you will live happy and
contented; for it must be a great satisfaction to live under a true and
legitimate prince.</p>

<p>'With regard to the requests you have made to my lord cardinal, you
will deliver them to him in writing, and he will return you such
answers as shall content you. It must, however, be understood, that
from this pardon all the principal actors and instigators of the late
rebellion are excepted.'</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>When this harangue was ended, all the children passed the cardinal in
procession, crying out 'France, France! France and mercy!'</p>

<p>On St George's day, the queen of France set out from Lyon, to go to St
Claude, with a very handsome company. Before she returned, she stood
godmother with the prince of Orange,&mdash;for the princess had, at that
time, been brought to bed of a son.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May, the lord Ludovico was brought to Lyon. He wore a robe
of black camlet, after the fashion of Lombardy, and was mounted on a
small mule. The provost of the royal household, and the seneschal of
Lyon, went out to meet him, made him a prisoner in the king's name, and
confined him in the castle of Pierre-en-Cise. Great numbers of people
were collected in the streets to see him pass. The king was then in
Lyon.</p>

<p>The 12th of May, the marriage of the lord de la Roche, a baron of
Brittany, was announced in Lyon, with the princess of Tarente, daughter
to don Frederic of Naples. On this occasion were many justs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> and
other entertainments, at which were present the queen, her ladies and
damsels,&mdash;and the wife of count Galeazzo was with the queen; but the
marriage did not take place until the 18th of May, at the church of St
Croix, near to that of St John. Tournaments again were exhibited on the
Grenette, and gave great satisfaction<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>The lord Ludovico was, by orders from the king and council transferred
from the castle of Pierre-en-Cise, on the 14th of May, to the castle of
Loches, near Bourges. On the 24th of the same month, the lord de Ligny
returned from Lombardy to Lyon, when the king sent out a large party to
meet and welcome him.</p>

<p>The cardinal Ascanius Sforza was on the 17th of June, the vigil of
Corpus-Christi-day, brought prisoner to Lyon, and confined, where his
brother had before been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> in the castle of Pierre-en-Cise; but he
afterwards found such favour with the king that he had all France for
his prison.</p>

<p>The lord-cardinal of Amboise and the lord de la Trimouille arrived at
Lyon, the 21st of June, from Lombardy, and brought with them the lord
Jean Jacques de Trivulce and his lady to France.</p>

<p>About the end of July, pope Alexander VII. was struck by lightning, at
Rome, and much hurt; but, recommending himself to God and our lady,
he was cured, and ordered a solemn procession, which he attended
in person, and granted a full absolution to all who assisted. This
happened, as said, on the vigil, or on the day preceding it, of the
feast of St Peter. The same day the king and queen of France left Lyon
for Troyes in Champagne, to meet an embassy from Germany that was

<p>On St Anne's day, the 26th of July, the king of Yvetot<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> died at
Lyon: he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> buried in the church of Sainte Croix, near to that of St
John.</p>

<p>The 28th, on a Sunday Morning, the last arch but one of the bridge over
the Rhône, at Lyon, near to Bechevelain, fell down: the wall and the
other arch remained,&mdash;but it could not be crossed without great danger,
and by going along the top of the wall.</p>

<p>This year, the Swiss made war on the king's territories,&mdash;on which
account his Swiss-guards returned home, but the war was soon put an end
to.&mdash;About St Simon and St Jude's day, M. de Bordeaux, archbishop of
Lyon, died, and was succeeded by François de Rohan, son to the marshal
de Gié.</p>

<p>The king of France, about this period, sent a doctor of divinity
from Paris to La Vaupute<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, to convert the inhabitants from some
fantastical opinions they had imbibed,&mdash;but he failed of success.</p>

<p>Near Christmas, the river Saone was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> frozen as high as Mâcon, which
prevented any corn and other victual coming to Lyon, and raised the
price of bread very high. On St Thomas's day, the Rhône suddenly rose
in the afternoon, and higher than was ever known in so short a time.</p>

<p>In the year 1501, the bishop of Amiens, a native of Burgundy, died at a
place called Arbois<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, and was succeeded by the bishop of Nevers.</p>

<p>A jubilee took place, this year, in France, for the support of a war
against the Turks,&mdash;and a tenth was raised, from all benefices, for the
same purpose.&mdash;The archduke Philip and his consort came, in the course
of the year, to Paris, and declared themselves friends to the king.
They went thence into Spain, where the archduchess was brought to bed
of a son.</p>

<p>A large body of infantry, with great stores of salted provision, were
ordered to Naples; and the king and queen went to Lyon, to see these
troops march through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> that city. The wife of duke Réné of Lorraine
came to Sainte Claude, with her son, and thence proceeded to wait on
the king and queen at Lyon. Her son remained at the court, and had a
pension; and on the mother's returning to Lorraine, the king presented
her with a white palfrey, most richly caparisoned in crimson velvet,
with knotted cord-work in embroidery.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> king was very anxious to recover his dominions in Naples, and, for

<p>THE FRENCH, AFTER THE CAPTURE OF NAPLES, MAKE WAR ON THE TURKS.</p>


<p ><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1502 was the jubilee for a croisade against the Turks. It
was, as said, celebrated throughout Christendom to excite every prince
to take up arms on the occasion. But there were divisions among them;
and all failed in their engagements excepting the king of France, who
showed himself deserving of his title of most Christian king.</p>

<p>After the conquest of Naples, he ordered his troops to make war on
the Turks by sea and land,&mdash;for they, having declared war against the
Venetians, had landed troops near to Venice. The french army were eager
to advance to the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>quest of Constantinople, under the command of
the lord Philip of Ravenstein; and they had undertaken the siege of
the town of Metelino, under a promise of pay, and of being victualled,
made by the Venetians to the king of France. They failed in the last
article, for the french army was five days without provision; and what
was worse, the Venetians allowed the Turks to march through part of
their territories, who fell on the French, killed numbers, and made
thirty-two prisoners,&mdash;for whose release the pope issued his pardons to
obtain the necessary sums, as is specified in the bull. By these means,
the french army was ruined; but had the promises made to the French
been kept, they would soon have conquered the greater part of Turkey.</p>

<p>Good-Friday, this year, falling on the feast of our Lady in March,
pardons were fully granted at the church of our Lady at Puys, in
Auvergne, where such multitudes attended that a melancholy accident
happened, by the falling down of a wall from the crowd pressing against
it, which killed numbers, and wounded more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> Several also perished from
the great pressure.</p>

<p>This year, a marriage was concluded between the king of Hungary and
Anne of Candale, daughter to the lord of Candale of the house of Foix.
She soon after made her public entry into Lyon, where several splendid
mysteries were represented, and thence continued her route to Hungary,
where the marriage was consummated, and they had a fine family of
children.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before St George's day, the prince of Orange died,
and was succeeded by his infant son.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the king of France went to Lombardy, and made his
public entry into Genoa, the inhabitants having placed themselves under
his dominion. The town made him many rich gifts,&mdash;and having staid
there some time, he returned to France in September. About this period,
Réné bastard of Savoy was driven out of that country, and took refuge
with the king of France, to the great displeasure of the duke and
duchess of Savoy; for Réné had revealed divers machinations that were
going forward to the prejudice of the crown of France. Shortly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> a suit
was instituted against the duchess, to recover some places which the
duke had given her, that belonged to Réné by purchase.</p>

<p>While the king was in Dauphiny, the duke and duchess of Savoy visited
the queen at Lyon, but made no public entry: they staid only four or
six days, and went back to Savoy a little before the king's return.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, the general of the order of cordelier friars came to
France, to establish a reform, and to make them follow the regulations
of the Observantines,&mdash;for the king would have it so, as he knew them
to be too worldly inclined, and that it was better to have ten good
monks than two thousand vicious ones.</p>

<p>On the vigil of St Martin's clay, the wife of don Frederic arrived in
France, with some of her children and attendants.</p>

<p>In the year 1503, the picture of our Lady of the Cloister, which had
been in the cloister of the cordeliers at Lyon was removed into the
church, and placed in the chapel of St Francis. This painting was so
large that the wall was broken down to ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>mit it into the chapel, where
it now is most richly decorated.</p>

<p>About the beginning of Lent, the king's palace at Dijon was burnt down,
by the firing a culverin up the chimney to clean it; the king soon
afterwards rebuilt it with greater magnificence.</p>

<p>The 21st of April, when the king was at Lyon, he made a general
abolition of a variety of tolls and imposts that had existed for
a hundred years, without any legal sanction,&mdash;with orders not to
re-establish them, under severe penalties. This was contained in
letters patent he granted to the merchants who trafficked on the Rhône
and Saone, and other navigable rivers falling into them, from the
town of Pontarlier, above Auxonne, to the sea,&mdash;and also to those who
trafficked by land through France, the Mâconnois, Lyonnois, Languedoc,
and Dauphiny. By these letters, all obstructions to the navigation,
such as wears, milldams, and the like, were ordered to be instantly
removed, excepting such as may have been particularly erected by the
king.</p>

<p>The french army at Naples gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> ground daily, and had nearly
conquered Sicily, so that all trembled before them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE ARCHDUKE MAKES HIS ENTRY INTO LYON.&mdash;ANOTHER HERETIC.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> archduke Philip made his public entry into Lyon the 23d of March,
and it was very handsome. He came from Spain; but before he entered the
king's territories, he demanded that five or six of the princes of the
blood should be sent to his country, as hostages for his safety during
his stay in France. This was done, for the king had no evil intentions;
but the archduke had made the above demand imagining that he might be
somewhat inclined to be suspicious of him.</p>

<p>The populace were rejoiced at his coming, because he was charged to
make peace between the kings of France and Spain, which he did; and it
was proclaimed while the king, queen, and their court were at Lyon, on
the 4th of April. The peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> included, beside the kings of France and
Spain, the archduke, the king of the Romans and their allies.</p>

<p>The archduke on leaving Lyon, went to Bourg en Bresse in Savoy, where
he met the duke, and his sister the duchess of Savoy.</p>

<p>About the 13th of April, the lord John de Horne, bishop of Liege,
waited on the king at Lyon, on account of a quarrel that had taken
place between him and the lord de la Marche, which they had mutually
referred for the king's decision, and he made peace between them.</p>

<p>The archduke had not been long at Bourg en Bresse before it was known
that the king of Spain had landed a large army at Naples, and had
instantly attacked the French unexpectedly,&mdash;for they understood that
they were at peace with Spain. Notwithstanding this, a severe conflict
took place,&mdash;and the duke of Nemours was killed treacherously. The
Spaniards conquered the town of Naples, in contradiction to the oath
their king had so lately made to observe the peace. It was said that
pope Alexander VII. had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> supplied the Spaniards with provision. The
lord d'Aubigny retired into Calabria with a few of his men; but had
the French been supported, they would have prevented the Spaniards
succeeding in their enterprise. It was likewise reported, that some of
the French had joined the Spaniards, having an understanding with the
king of Spain,&mdash;but this perhaps was discovered afterwards. The lord de
la Trimouille was, in consequence, sent to Naples as lieutenant-general
for the king; but he was seized with so grievous a malady on his road,
he was forced to return to France.</p>

<p>In this year, an extraordinary event happened at Paris. A young
scholar, twenty-two years old, a native of Abbeville, whose parents
were of worth, and much respected, went on the feast of St Louis,
to the holy chapel in the palace, while mass was celebrating at an
altar on the right hand. When the priest was about to consecrate
the host, this scholar snatched it out of his hands, and ran away
with it into the court fronting the exchequer-chamber. Perceiving
that he was pursued, he tore the wafer into pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> and flung them
on the pavement. When, taken, he was confined in the prison of the
Conciergerie,&mdash;but no exhortations could make him repent. Upon this
his parents were sent for, who were much grieved at his conduct, more
especially for his obstinacy and malice,&mdash;and the mother died in Paris
of grief.</p>

<p>The father renounced his son for a heretic, and wanted to put him to
death with his own hands. When brought before the court of parliament,
he was asked of what religion he was; and replied, Of the religion
of nature. It was said that he had frequented the company of some
scholars from Spain, who had fled. A general procession was made to
the holy chapel, to offer up prayers to God that the scholar might
be converted,&mdash;and a sermon was preached, while he was present, by
an eminent doctor. The court of parliament finding him obstinate,
condemned him to be dragged from prison to the place where he had
thrown down the host; then to be put into a tumbril, and have his
wrist cut off, and carried to the pig-market to be burnt. He was
accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>panied all the time by three doctors, who earnestly exhorted him
to repent,&mdash;namely, master John Standun, a Cordelier, and a Jacobin:
the first never left him until dead, notwithstanding he continued in
his obstinacy to the last.</p>

<p>From the time this impiety had been committed, a canopy of cloth of
gold was supported over the spot where the host had fallen, with two
burning tapers beside it. The pavement was taken up, and carried to
the holy chapel, with such parts of the wafer as could be found, to be
preserved as relics, and the place repaved.</p>

<p>Toward the end of August, in this year, pope Alexander VII. died.
The king was then at Mâcon, and immediately ordered the cardinal of
Amboise, the cardinal Ascanius Sforza, then a prisoner in France, the
cardinal of St George, with other cardinals, to repair to Rome, for the
election of a pope.</p>

<p>About nine or ten o'clock of the Monday, before Michaelmas-day, the
whole arch of the bridge over the Rhône at Lyon fell down.</p>

<p>The cardinal of Sienna, nephew to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> pope Pius II. was elected pope, and
took the name of Pius III., but did not live more than eight or ten
days after his exaltation. During that short space, he had already
shown how very much he was indisposed against the French. He was the
hundred and sixth pope.</p>

<p>On Wednesday preceding St Luke's day, the lord Peter of Bourbon died,
while the king was at Mâcon: he was much bewailed, for he had ever been
true and loyal to the crown of France, and was an able counsellor.</p>

<p>The 19th of October, died pope Pius III. at Rome, who, as I have said,
did not outlive his election more than eight or ten days,&mdash;and the
cardinals made another election.</p>

<p>The French at Naples slew very many Spaniards,&mdash;and had they been
properly supported, they would have driven them thence, for the lord
d'Aubigny evinced much valour and prudence.</p>

Francis de Savona<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, was elected the hundred and seventh pope of
Rome, and took the name of Julius II. He was nephew to the late pope,
Sixtus IV. and had accompanied king Charles of France at the conquest
of Naples. After his election, he made his nephew cardinal of St Pietro
ad vincula, and legate of Avignon.</p>

<p>The french army before Saulse<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, in the county of Roussillon, was
badly conducted by some in whom the king had great confidence; for it
was so well equipped, wonders were expected from it. The commanders
might have taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> castle and the garrison, on allowing their
captains to march away in safety; but although many were for it,
the majority were against them. The castle was mined to its very
foundations, and the army was so strongly encamped it could not
be hurt; but the king of Spain, by dint of money, as it was known
afterwards, blinded the eyes of the commanders, to the astonishment and
vexation of all loyal Frenchmen when it was discovered.</p>

<p>The commander in chief, the marshal de Rieux, a Breton, marched away
to Narbonne, to the great discontent of the French, as the camp was
left without a leader. Every one behaved with the utmost courage, and
raised the siege, carrying off the artillery and baggage without loss
in their retreat. However, had all behaved as they ought to have done,
conformable to their engagements with the king, in a short time they
would have made great advances into the enemy's country, considering
the fine army of the French.</p>

<p>The lord de la Roche-pot was killed, when before Saulse, by a cannon
shot: it was a great loss, for he was a good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> valiant knight, and
the king and whole court were much grieved at it.&mdash;The french army in
Naples not only kept its ground, but even made some conquests.</p>

<p>On Christmas-eve, in this year, the lord Louis of Luxembourg, lord of
Ligny, died, about twelve o'clock at night at Lyon, and was very much
regretted by the king and all who knew him, for he was universally
beloved.</p>

<p>The 3d day of July, in this year, died Pierre cardinal of Aubusson<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,
grand master of Rhodes, which he had governed for twenty-seven years:
during the early part of which, Rhodes was attacked by the Turks with
an immense army: but he and his knights made so gallant a defence, he
was victorious, and the Turks left upwards of forty thousand dead: the
rest saved themselves by flight, to the great vexation of all Turkey,
in spite of their cries, 'Mahoun, avenge us!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>The sultan, finding this army defeated, uttered a horrid cry, to the
alarm of his attendants, and swore to march another to Rhodes, and have
ample revenge; but while he was employed in making preparations, he
died. The grand master of Rhodes detained the next heir to the sultan
a prisoner for thirteen years, contrary to the will of many, and then
delivered him up to the pope, who, in return, sent him a cardinal's
hat. He had those fortifications repaired that had been damaged by
the Turks, and then converted the Jews in the island to Christianity.
He formed alliances with all the princes in Christendom, and did an
infinite deal of good. He was succeeded by Emeri d'Amboise, brother to
the cardinal of Amboise, legate to France, who instantly left France
for Rhodes, to oppose the Turks, who were continually carrying on a
warfare against the Christians.</p>

arrival of his attendants. But he disguised his feelings of injury from
the grand Turk, who detained his Sophines in abject vassalage: however,
within a fortnight, he was joined by about sixteen thousand men, with
whom he entered Arzian by force, and put to death all the inhabitants,
both great and small.</p>

<p>Among other acts worthy of remembrance, in all the mosques, or temples,
of the Turks, he had the horses and camels tied up as in a stable,
to show his contempt for them, and had them afterwards razed to the
ground. There had been a temple of the Christians which the Turks
had destroyed; but Sophi had it immediately re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>built, and handsomely
restored. The army of Sophi continually increasing, he advanced into
the province of Firnam, which belonged also to Usson Cassan. Usson
Cassan perceiving that Sophi was subjugating his country, and the whole
of the Turks in this province, amounting to more than fifty thousand,
assembled his army, and offered battle to Sophi, who defeated him
completely, and made him prisoner. He entered victoriously the town of
Sarda, where he staid three months, and thence advanced to Tharabe, a
town of Usson Cassan, which instantly surrendered.</p>

<p>As he approached the country of Sultania, he was met by the children
of Usson Cassan, with an army of twenty-five thousand men. Sophi gave
them battle, and defeated them. One of the children was killed in the
combat: the others were taken prisoners, and put to a disgraceful death
by cutting them in pieces. Not one of their army was permitted to live.</p>

<p>The city of Tauris, seeing the great power of Sophi, and that he had
destroyed their prince and his children, surrendered to him without any
defence,&mdash;and he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>mained there with his army some time. The citizens
of Tauris, observing the great prudence and wisdom of Sophi, put him
in possession of all the treasures of Usson Cassan. He thence departed
to a large town called Lingia, three days journey from Tauris, and to
another called Passy, the last town of Usson Cassan.</p>

<p>Sophi, finding that he had now conquered and submitted to his obedience
the whole of the dominions of Usson Cassan, and established order
every where, returned to Tauris, the capital of the country. He was
continually followed by his mother, with a numerous attendance of
slaves, for he was much beloved by her; and after a short stay at
Tauris, she sent ambassadors to the grand Turk, to remonstrate with
him on his shameful conduct to the Sophines,&mdash;ordering him to set them
at liberty, and also to put on the red bonnet, after the manner of the
Sophines, otherwise she would make him feel the power of her son.</p>

<p>The grand Turk detained the ambassadors in Constantinople, for he
suspected that Sophi would invade his country of Natolia; and in
consequence, he assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> a large army near to the town of Angora<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>,
and commanded all in Pera<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to hold themselves in readiness to
bear arms against Sophi Christian or Red Bonnet. They were, however,
refractory, and refused to obey, showing more willingness to surrender
themselves to Sophi. The Armenians say, that Sophi does not esteem the
grand Turk a button,&mdash;for he has an army of ninety thousand men, well
armed, without including his own countrymen from Armenia, who daily
follow him. All this information was brought to the king of France,
when he was at Morestel<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in Dauphiny, in the year 1503.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A GREAT MORTALITY FROM THE UNWHOLESOMENESS OF THE SEASON.&mdash;OF THE
DEATHS OF MANY PERSONS OF NOTE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of the year 1504, a truce was concluded between the kings
of France and Spain, touching the county of Roussillon: nevertheless,
the Spaniards that had been garrisoned in Saulse embarked secretly for
Naples. It was said, that the king of Spain had bribed some of the
French (of which they were afterwards accused), and by this means he
had conquered Naples.</p>

<p>The lord of Aubigny and the lord of Alegre, the principal leaders of
the french army, were made prisoners; and great numbers of their men
perished, more from want of food than in battle, for there was no great
effusion of blood. The lieutenant of the lord of Ligny maintained his
post in the territories of that lord's deceased wife,&mdash;and the French,
notwithstanding the spanish force, made several good prisoners, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
were exchanged for the lords of Aubigny and of Alegre.</p>

<p>This summer was exceedingly hot and dry, which prevented the corn from
filling; and the harvest was very poor in the Lyonnois, Dauphiny,
Auvergne, Burgundy, Savoy, and other countries. From the month of
March, the farmers and peasants, foreseeing the season would be
unproductive, were in great distress, and made processions to different
churches in all the villages around: general processions were even made
by the peasants to the churches in Lyon, where the inhabitants and
monks gave them bread and wine in abundance.</p>

<p>In these processions, the young women were dressed in white linen, with
bare feet, a kerchief on their heads, and a taper in their hands: the
boys were clothed also in white, bare headed and bare footed: then came
the priests, followed by persons of both sexes, the women singing from
the Litany, 'Sancta Maria! ora pro nobis,' and then the whole cried
aloud for 'Mercy!'</p>

<p>The parishes of Lyon made similar processions to the church of our Lady
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> the island, a french league distant from that city. On the last
day but one of May, the body of St Just was brought from the suburbs
into the city of Lyon, which no man living had before seen done; and
his shrine was carried in procession, with chaunting and singing, from
church to church. On the following day, the jaw bone of St John the
baptist, which had never before been taken out of the church of St
John, was carried in procession to the church of the Augustins.</p>

<p>Eight days afterwards, it rained; but the drought was soon as great as
ever. The monks of Nôtre Dame de l'Isle, attended by the inhabitants of
many villages, brought her image, and that of St Loup, in procession to
Lyon, which had not been done in the memory of man. This was on the 7th
of June; and at the same time was brought thither the shrine of Saint
Hereny, prince of the nineteen thousand martyrs.</p>

<p>Processions came to Lyon four and five leagues distant; and the
inhabitants of several villages were from five to six days wandering
about the fields, from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> place to another, without returning home.
In short, every body appeared so miserable, the hardest hearts must
have wept on beholding this great desolation of the people, and have
quitted all amusements to assist them.</p>

<p>In the month of September, there appeared in the river Saone, above
Lyon, a prodigious quantity of small eels, of the size of a man's
little finger, but no one dared to eat of them. Great sickness now
prevailed; and on the 19th of September Philibert duke of Savoy died at
Pont d'Ain, not without suspicions of poison. He was succeeded by his
next brother: the other was bishop of Geneva.</p>

<p>In the year 1505 died the lady Jane duchess of Berry, and was interred
in a chapel, within the castle of Bourges she had founded and endowed.
From St John's day of last year until that feast in this, the season
was most sickly, and every thing very dear. Wheat sold at Lyon from
twenty-six to twenty-seven sols the bichet<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and from the scarcity
in the country vast numbers came from the villages to Lyon to seek
charity. Some left their houses empty, others their wives and children,
and the women their husbands and children. Great part of them died,
although every person who had wherewithal gave them food; for alms were
as abundantly bestowed in Lyon as in any city of its size.</p>

<p>A pestilential disorder now raged, which carried off immense numbers in
the hospital, both rich and poor; and this pestilence seemed to be felt
every where, for, in the mountains of Savoy, several died of it, and of
hunger, so that many farms were this year uncultivated.</p>

<p>During Lent, the king of France had the bones of his late father,
Charles duke of Orleans, removed from Blois to Paris, and interred in
the chapel of the Celestins at Paris, which the dukes of Orleans had
founded. Every kind of honour was paid to them during their removal,
and at their re-interment,&mdash;and it was a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>About this time, the king was taken with so serious an illness it was
thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> must die. His nobles and courtiers were much grieved:
many of them made divers vows and pilgrimages; and processions were
ordered throughout the realm, to offer up prayers to Jesus Christ for
the king's recovery, which was granted. While he lay speechless, he
had a vision, which he related; and it was so marvellous that I firmly
believe it to be more a miracle than any thing else. A short time
after his recovery, the king solicited the pope to grant a jubilee for
his kingdom of France, and other parts under his dominion, without
any expenses. On the 26th of June, the feast of St Peter and St Paul,
a great procession took place, in which the host was carried as on
Corpus-Christi-day, when the king, knowing how earnestly his people
had prayed for the restoration of his health, would not show himself
ungrateful, but, to reward them, solicited of the pope for this free
jubilee.</p>

<p>In this year, don Frederick of Naples died, to whom the king had
behaved with the utmost liberality touching his claims on Naples.</p>

<p>In the year 1506, died, Isabella queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> of Spain, who, during the wars
of Granada, had shown great valour and prudence. The king of Spain
was afterwards married to the sister of the lord of Foix, through the
interference of the king of France, who, in consideration of the match,
made some agreements with the king of Spain respecting Roussillon and
Naples.</p>

<p>A war now took place between the duke of Savoy and the Valoisiens, but
it was soon made an end of.&mdash;In the month of July, a general chapter
of the Cordeliers was held at Rome, which had not been done since the
death of their founder St Francis. It was caused, as said, by the
reformation of the Cordeliers in France, which dissatisfied several of
the fraternity,&mdash;and it was in this chapter determined by the pope,
that there should be only two modes of living among them; that such as
had been reformed should remain so: consequently, all the convents of
Cordeliers in France follow the rules of the Observantines.</p>

<p>At this time also, a general chapter of the knights of Rhodes was
holden at Rome, and many knights were drowned in coming thither, from
tempests at sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 18th of July, the feast-day of St Pantaléone, a general pardon
was granted to all repentant and confessed sinners, who should bequeath
money or lands to the churches founded by the knights of Rhodes. This
was done on account of a great victory the new grand master, brother
to the cardinal of Amboise, had gained over the Turks. He had defeated
their whole army, which was worthy of remembrance.</p>

<p>On Ascension-day, in this year, the count of Angoulême<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, the second
person in France, was betrothed, at Tours, to the princess Claude of
France, only daughter to Louis XII. by Anne of Brittany, which caused
great feasts and rejoicings throughout the kingdom.&mdash;The reverend
father in God the lord Francis of Rohan, son to the marshal of Gié, and
archbishop of Lyon, made his public entry into that city on the 14th of
August. Many mysteries were exhibited in the streets through which he
passed, and they were all hung with tapestries. On the following day,
the least of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> the Assumption of our Lady, he chaunted the high mass at
the cathedral of St John in his archiepiscopal robes.</p>

<p>This year, the duke of Gueldres made war on that part of Guelderland
dependant on the archduke.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE POPE, BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FRENCH, GAINS BOLOGNA.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">Pope</span> Julius II. weighing in his mind that the whole of the territories
of Bologna were the patrimony of the church, made preparations to
reduce them to his obedience. This city and territory had been usurped,
and held by force for some time, by sir John de Bentivoglio. The pope,
considering that there was no prince in all Christendom so well able
to afford him support in this project as the king of France (that firm
pillar of the church, who had been every where victorious), made him
acquainted with his claims and intentions of recovering the bolognese
territories.</p>

<p>The king, eager to serve the holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> church, ordered a large detachment
of men at arms to join the pope's forces from the Milanese, for him
to use at his pleasure. The pope's army was besieging Bologna on the
side toward Rome,&mdash;but when joined by the French, it was besieged
on all sides. This took place in the month of October. The French,
stationed on the side toward Modena, behaved very gallantly, and won
Castel-franco, which was plundered because the garrison would not
surrender. The pope's army gained another castle,&mdash;and both armies
showed so much courage, the Bolognese were astonished and frightened:
they found themselves closely besieged, and that it would be impossible
for them to resist the pope and the king of France. Finding their
situation desperate, they surrendered themselves to the pope, having
driven sir John de Bentivoglio out of Bologna, who, as I have before
said, held the town by force, although it lawfully belonged to the pope.</p>

<p>The pope offered up thanksgivings to God the Creator for his success,
and chaunted high mass most devoutly, on All-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>souls-day, in the church

<blockquote>

<p>OF THE DAMSEL TRIVULCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">About</span> this time, there resided a young lady in the Milanese, who had
been taught the rudiments of grammar at seven years of age, and was so
earnest in her studies that, at fourteen, she was eloquent to a degree
that astonished all who heard her.</p>

<p>She was descended from the noble family of the Trivulces. Her father,
called John, was an able knight and good scholar, as were all of his
family. Her mother's name was Angela, a noble lady of the race of the
Martinengois. In praise of this young lady, the verse of Prosper may
be well applied,&mdash;'Naturæ sequitur semina quisque suæ.' Her mother was
not a learned lady, although full of virtue; but the daughter was so
devout and elo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>quent, in her prayers, that she seemed more angelic than
human; and if she continues to abound in such virtues, and to live thus
sanctified and devout, she will deservedly be worthy of her reputation
of a saint.</p>

<p>At twelve years of age, she became a great disputant, and was
invited into the companies of the most learned, as well secular as
ecclesiastic,&mdash;among whom were the bishop of Lausanne, an eminent
scholar, her uncles the bishop of Cumense<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and Francis Trivulce,
of the order of franciscan friars, when several disputations took
place,&mdash;and great praises were given to this damsel. She understood
philosophy, history, and different sciences, was mistress of Seneca,
Aristotle, and Pietro of Ravenna. Whatever she saw or heard at any of
the places she visited, she related the whole to her father, on her
return home, as exactly as if it had been written down.</p>

<p>She was skilful in poetry, and one day composed so long a poem her
master was surprised at her talent. She became soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> expert in the
greek tongue, and wrote many letters, in that and in other languages,
that were greatly admired by all the learned to whom they had been
addressed. She was most patient in adversity, making a joke of it: in
short, every thing she did or said was miraculous, and unlike to a
human being. When marriage was spoken of to her, she replied, that she
would never marry a man whom she did not know to be as pure in virtue
as herself.</p>

<p>The Genoese, acting according to their accustomed treachery, forgetful
of the crimes they had committed, and been pardoned for by the king,
now rebelled against him, and chose for their doge one called Paul
Noyus<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, who had been a silk dyer. The king, hearing of this,
resolved to march in person against them, and reduce them to his
obedience, notwithstanding the great preparations the Genoese had made
for resistance. They had, among other things, erected a bulwark they
thought impregnable; but some bold french adventurers having secretly
mounted this bulwark, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> hearts of the Genoese failed them, and they
fled into the town. They now offered to surrender themselves to the
king's mercy, who, from his uncommon benignity, and wish to avoid the
effusion of human blood, pardoned them, and entered the town with his
whole army, where he had a magnificent reception. Their lately-elected
doge, Paul di Nove, was taken at sea by a french bark, when making his
escape, brought back to Genoa, and beheaded. From this time forward,
it was publicly proclaimed, that the populace should not shout 'Adorne
Fregose<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>!' which they had been accustomed to do before this last
reduction of the town.</p>

<p>OF THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAY, FORMED BY THE CARDINAL OF AMBOISE, BETWEEN
THE POPE, THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN, THE KING OF FRANCE, AND THE KING
OF SPAIN, AGAINST THE VENETIANS.&mdash;THE KING OF FRANCE DEFEATS THE
VENETIANS AT AGNADELLO.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> king of France, about this time, through the means of the cardinal
of Amboise, concluded a treaty at Cambray between the pope, the
emperor, the king of Spain, and the lady Margaret, governess of the
low countries. This treaty, although of no long duration, was the
cause of the deaths of two hundred thousand men, as you will hereafter
see, through the treachery of the confederates, in various battles and
engagements that took place; and what is worse, we of the present time,
unless God shall be pleased to apply a remedy, are still suffering from
the effects of this unfortunate treaty.</p>

<p>The king thought to obtain by it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> lasting peace and alliance with the
adjoining princes; but he was deceived, as was apparent at the time
of the affair of Peschiera, against the Venetians; for he alone, of
all the confederates, took the field, crossed the Alps, and advanced
to Milan. He thence marched his army, and what is worthy of remark,
had all the bridges broken down he passed over, to show that flight
would be needless. His first conquest was the castle of Trevi. He then
marched his army to Peschiera, near to which was Agnadello, where
the battle was fought. Five days after the camp had been formed at
Peschiera, the Venetian army was attacked, and completely routed,
chiefly by the great exertions of the lord of Bourbon, who fought
manfully: there was great slaughter. The confederates never thought
that this could have been accomplished by the french army alone. Indeed
the Venetians would not believe it until the count de Pitigliano, who
had fled with the reserve, convinced them of its truth. This battle
took place on the 14th of May, just six days after the king arrived in
the camp, and it was certainly very fortunate. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> the war lasted but
five days; for after such a victory, there was nothing to prevent the
king obtaining all his demands.</p>

<p>I repeat, that this success was very fortunate, considering how
advantageously the enemy were posted, the number of strong places
in their possession, and the strength of their armies; for they had
enow to oppose the confederates in the field and to guard their
strong holds. In their camp were more than seventeen hundred men at
arms, light cavalry to the amount of nine thousand five hundred,
and twenty-two thousand infantry well armed, with twenty pieces of
large artillery, much superior to what the king had, and also the
best captains in all Italy to command this army, particularly sir
Bartholomew d'Alviano, the chief, taken prisoner as he was rallying a
body of infantry.</p>

<p>Numbers of the most renowned of the venetian captains were made
prisoners this day, and sent to different strong castles in
France,&mdash;their banners to the church of St Denis. Not more than two
hundred were slain of the king's army, while full fifteen thousand
fell on the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> enemy. After the battle, the king ordered the
dead to be buried, and a chapel to be erected on the spot, endowed
sufficiently for the celebration of daily masses for the souls of those
who had died in a state of grace. It was not long afterward before
those towns which the Venetians had usurped surrendered to the king's
obedience,&mdash;such as Bergamo, Brescia, Crema, Cremona, that had formed
part of the duchy of Milan.</p>

<p>The pope, in like manner, recovered those places that had been taken
from the church, namely, Ravenna, Imola, Faienza, and Forli. The
emperor Maximilian regained from the Venetians his towns of Verona,
Vicenza, and Padua,&mdash;but this last he did not keep long. Whether
through negligence or fear, he had never dared to come to the king's
camp, notwithstanding his repeated promises: the king, however, gave
him a large body of men, under the command of the lord de la Palisse,
to regain the city of Padua,&mdash;and it was long besieged, but nothing
effectual was done at last.</p>

<p>The king of Spain also regained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> towns of Brundusium, Tarentum, and
others, of which the Venetians had possessed themselves.</p>

<p>When all this had been done through the fortunate victory of the king
of France, who had supported the pope like a true son of the church,
and had so essentially served him in the restoration of Bologna by the
expulsion of Bentivoglio, and in various other ways,&mdash;notwithstanding
all these proofs of his friendship, pope Julius, at the instigation of
the Venetians and others, formed an alliance against him, and, having
joined his arms with those of Venice, took Udina and Mirandola; which
last he restored to John Franciscus Picus, who styled himself the true
lord of it.</p>

<p>To return to the king of France: after his victory over the Venetians,
he went to Milan, where a magnificent triumphal entry was prepared
for him, after the manner of the ancient Romans. Brilliant cars, full
of the handsomest and best dressed ladies in Milan, went out to meet
him,&mdash;and the people greeted him with acclamations, comparing him to
Cæsar, for having conquered and reduced to his subjection those who
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> been feared and dreaded by all the world before.</p>

<p>The king, having had so handsome a reception in Milan, went thence
to Savona, where he was met by Ferdinand, who had come thither with
a numerous fleet of galleys for the purpose. The king of France
received him and his queen with much kindness, and they made good cheer
together. They confirmed their peace by dividing the eucharist between
them at the holy sacrament; but it lasted not long, notwithstanding
this ceremony, as you will hereafter see. There are many who make a
good sale of their consciences and promises; and one of them, instead
of the host, ought to have swallowed a burning coal,&mdash;for numberless
creatures have paid dear for perjuries of which they were innocent, and
had no concern with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A WAR BETWEEN POPE JULIUS AND THE KING OF FRANCE, ON ACCOUNT OF THE
DUKE OF FERRARA.&mdash;A COUNCIL OF THE CHURCH ASSEMBLED AT THE INSTANCE OF
THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN AND THE KING OF FRANCE, TO THE DISSATISFACTION
OF THE POPE.&mdash;BOLOGNA TAKEN BY THE FRENCH.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">About</span> this time, the town of Mirandola was valiantly reconquered by
the French, and the town of Udina delivered up to the king of the
Romans. The marquis of Mantua was taken prisoner by the Venetians,
and carried to Venice, whence, some time after, he easily obtained
his liberty. A fresh war now commenced between the pope and the duke
of Ferrara, an ally of France,&mdash;for which reason, the king left the
count Gaston de Foix, whom he had lately created duke of Nemours, his
lieutenant-general in the Milanese, who did marvellous feats of arms
during his command in Italy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The lord-cardinal of Amboise, on his last return from Italy, fell
sick at Lyon, and died there. His loss was great, as was afterwards
known, although at the time some thought the contrary; but they were
unacquainted with his many virtues, and the good use he made of his
talents,&mdash;for during the whole of his administration, he advised his
master with such wisdom that the people were never over-taxed. Whatever
wars king Louis may have carried on in Italy, the taxes were never
raised above their usual rates; but when the enemy attempted to bring
the war on the french territory, it became absolutely necessary to
increase them.</p>

<p>The king was, not without foundation, called 'the father of his
people,' notwithstanding that title may have been given him during his
life through flattery, and the worth of other kings debased, the more
to exalt his own. It is impossible to say too much of a virtuous man
in his absence; but when present, to praise him smells strongly of the
love of lucre.</p>

<p>The cardinal-legate having lain in state for a short time, the body
was em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>balmed, put into a leaden coffin, and carried to Rouen for
interment. The king came thence to Blois, accompanied by the queen,
then far gone with child of a daughter, as it turned out afterward,
whom the king had vowed to the holy St Réné, a bishop of Angers,
whither he made a pilgrimage with the queen when she recovered. The
young princess was christened Renée,&mdash;and the lord Jean Jacques de
Trivulce stood godfather with the king.</p>

<p>About this time, the Portuguese made some discoveries on the island of
Oran<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, on the coast of Africa, where they met savages of a blackish
colour, with countenances as if branded with hot irons, thick lips,
black and coarse hair, resembling in thickness that of a horse. They
had no beard, nor appearance of any, or of hair on any parts of the
body but on the head and eye-brows. Their boats are made of the bark
of trees, and so light, a man can with ease carry one of them. Their
bows are bent with the sinews of wild beasts:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> their arrows of cane,
headed with a sharp stone or piece of fish-bone. They know not the use
of bread or wine, nor the value of money, and crawl on the earth like
beasts, feeding on raw flesh, and covered with skins for clothing. They
live part of their time in the sea. Two of these natives were brought
by some Normans to Rouen, and presented to the king; but they did not
live long, nor did the others that had been brought to Europe.</p>

<p>But to return to my former subject: a general council was demanded
by the emperor, and king of France, to the great discontent of the
pope. He had broken his faith, by instigating the king of Arragon, the
republic of Venice, and others, to commence a new war, quitting the
chair of Saint Peter for the car of Mars, the god of war, displaying
in the field of battle his triple crown, and sleeping in watchtowers.
God knows what a sight of crosses, mitres, and sacred banners, were
fluttering in the plains; and the devil took good care not to come
near,&mdash;for benedictions were given most abundantly, and at the cheapest
rates.</p>

<p>The war commenced against the duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> of Ferrara, ally to the king,
when many engagements took place, sieges were made and raised, for it
was continued without interruption of winter and summer. Bologna was
besieged by the duke of Nemours, who acted as viceroy in Italy, and
the Bolognese fled before him, so that he soon reconquered that town,
as you shall hear. About this time, pope Julius excited the Swiss to
invade the duchy of Milan, which they did, and advanced to the walls
of that city, committing every sort of mischief, particularly to a
monastery of nuns, whom they ravished, and plundered the convent of all
within it.</p>

<p>The lord de Conti, like a valorous knight, hastened to their relief,
and did wonders; but he was surrounded, and fell, which was a great
pity.&mdash;Soon after, the duke of Nemours made an agreement with them to
return home, on receiving a sum of money,&mdash;which they accepted and
retreated, to return again to seek more money.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Brescia were now (unfortunately for them) advised
to quit the french interest, and put themselves under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> the dominion
of Venice, for which they severely suffered. In like manner, those of
Bergamo revolted to the Venetians,&mdash;but the castles of both places
remained in the hands of the French, under the command of able
captains, who gallantly served the king, especially in his italian
wars, for which some of them were but badly recompensed.</p>

<p>The council<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> before mentioned was first held at Tours, then at
Lyon, and then referred to a general council at Pisa, where were many
cardinals, archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, and other prelates
of the church. There were likewise some very learned theologians, and
canonists, to whom this affair would afford matter of discus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>sion.
Several essential points were determined on in the different sessions
of this council; but, for weighty reasons, the council was transferred
to Milan, and thence to Lyon, where it remained.</p>

<p>The french army suffered much at the siege of Bologna, from the rigour
of the weather: but, notwithstanding this, they were victorious,
drove out of the town the pope and his archbishops, and entered it as
conquerors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE DUKE OF NEMOURS MARCHES HIS ARMY AGAINST BRESCIA.&mdash;ON TAKING THE
TOWN, A GREAT SLAUGHTER ENSUES.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">When</span> the duke of Nemours heard of the revolt of Brescia, and that
the Venetians had entered the town, he instantly made preparations
to attack them, and with great diligence, marched day and night to
Brescia; for I can promise you, that the king had, at that time, an
excellent army,&mdash;and the liberal promises of the duke of Nemours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> urged
them on, so that they were almost immediately before it.</p>

<p>Those in the castle, on the first appearance of their countrymen,
opened the gate, and part of them forced their way thence in the
town. Alas! what a deluge! what cries! what lamentations of the poor
citizens! It is a great pity, and wonderful how many suffer in the
support of the quarrels of princes and great lords: however, in this
instance, they had deserved punishment, for having wantonly broken
their oaths of allegiance.</p>

<p>The duke of Nemours had no sooner gained the castle and palace than,
like a great warrior as he was, he entered the town, one arm bare, and
his sword on his wrist, shouting out 'France!' in which he was echoed
by all Frenchmen. The Venetians, thunderstruck, took to flight through
one of the gates, but numbers were slain<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and made prisoners, of
whom were many of high rank in Venice, who were sent to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>The inhabitants having attempted to defend themselves, the town was
given up to plunder; and you might have seen several french adventurers
tearing to pieces, out of spite, large bales of cloths of gold and of
silk; such merchandise might then have been bought for almost nothing.
The ladies and children made piteous moans on seeing their husbands and
fathers murdered and cast out of the windows, and all their effects
pillaged. To make short of the matter: they thought that God's whole
indignation and wrath had been poured on them; for the French treated
them with every cruelty, in revenge for the resistance that had been
made by throwing stones and beams from the tops of the houses, by which
some great french lords suffered severely. The place was completely
conquered, in spite of all that the Brescians and Venetians could do to
prevent it,&mdash;and the streets were filled with dead bodies, besides the
numbers that were slain in the open country: in the whole, there must
have been many thousands killed. Among the prisoners were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> sir Andrew
Gritti, sir John Paulle<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, Caufre and his son, the count Ludovico
Adanago<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, who had been the chief adviser of the town to revolt, for
which it had been treated as you have heard.</p>

<p>After this victory, the towns and castles in the territories of Brescia
were re-garrisoned, and provided with abundance of provision and
stores of all kinds,&mdash;and the lord d'Aubigny was appointed governor of
Brescia. The town of Bergamo also surrendered, as well as several other
places, which had revolted, and in consequence suffered great miseries.</p>

<p>News was brought to the duke of Nemours, that the Spaniards had left
all their heavy artillery and baggage at Imola, and were advancing,
by forced marches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> into the plain, boasting that they would form a
junction with the Venetians and relieve Brescia; but I believe that,
when they learned what had passed there, they changed their intentions.</p>

<p>About this time, there lived in the town of Augsbourg a virgin, named
Anne, who had arrived at the age of forty years, without eating,
drinking, sleeping, or having any natural evacuations!!! by which it
may be known, that she was under the especial grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ,&mdash;and she had given herself up to devout contemplations.</p>

<p>Another great wonder was seen in the city of Ravenna, where a monster
was born with a horn on its head, wings of a bat, one foot like a
bird of prey, the other like a human foot! It had an eye on its knee,
and was of both sexes! It had a mark of a Y on its breast, and an
appearance of a cross, with a crescent beneath,&mdash;which signs, according
to my lords the philosophers and prognosticators, signify many things!!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE DUKE OF NEMOURS DEFEATS THE UNITED ARMIES OF THE POPE, THE
VENETIANS, AND THE SPANIARDS, NEAR TO RAVENNA,&mdash;BUT IS HIMSELF SLAIN,
AFTER HE HAD GAINED THE VICTORY AND TOTALLY REPULSED THE ENEMY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">We</span> must now return to the wars in Italy, and elsewhere. During the
Lent of the year 1512, the duke of Nemours marched his army before
Ravenna, wherein that of the pope, the Venetians, and Spaniards were
seeking opportunities to retaliate on the French,&mdash;and they had made
great preparations for this purpose. The duke of Nemours, having had
information of this, advanced thither, accompanied by many nobles and
valiant captains, such as the lord de la Palisse, the lord d'Alegre
and his son, the lord Jean Jacques of Trivulce, the lord de Châtillon
governor of Paris, the lord de Molarc, Maugeron, La Crotte, and other
officers of renown. When he had approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> Ravenna, the French
remained some time encamped from a scarcity of provision, and many
suffered by it. Perceiving that their supplies had failed, like hardy
warriors, stirred on by the eager desire of the duke of Nemours for the
combat, they resolved, on the eve of Easter-day, to offer the enemy
battle on the morrow, which was the feast of the Resurrection of our
Lord.</p>

<p>The French advanced boldly to the combat, having their artillery in
front, which played four hours incessantly, and did great damage to the
Spaniards, principally to their men at arms. Some Spaniards sallied out
of their camp, and the French rushed in,&mdash;when both parties met, and
two superb and bold nations might then be seen contending with courage
and earnestness for the victory. Never was heard such clattering of
swords and lances: the gallant duke of Nemours hastened forward,
fighting most wonderfully, to encourage his men; and it was for some
time uncertain which side would have the advantage,&mdash;for the Spaniards
shouted at times 'Victory! Julius, Julius!' at others, the French cried
out 'Victory, Nemours!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> At length, the French made their enemies fly.</p>

<p>During the battle, the lord de Molarc was killed by a cannon-shot,&mdash;a
great loss to the king, for he was a valiant, and enterprising captain.
He led that day the french infantry, a most courageous and steady band.
La Crotte and captain Jacobs, who commanded the Lansquenets, were among
the first of the slain; and their loss was a heavy blow: however, both
French and Lansquenets advanced with greater courage to revenge the
deaths of their captains, and pushed on until they came to where the
baggage was, and some famished adventurers had already begun to knock
in the heads of the casks of different wines,&mdash;when, having drank
their fill, they ran away as fast as they could: not so the Spaniards,
who still held on fighting,&mdash;for I can assure you, that these spanish
troops were no way fainthearted, and there had not been so severe a
battle fought as this for a long time. May God pardon those who were
killed!</p>

<p>The remnant of the Spaniards and Italians that escaped wandered here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and there. Upwards of twenty of the great lords of Italy lay dead on
the field. There were many prisoners made: in the number were Pedro
de Navarre, don John de Cardona, the marquis of Pescara, Pomare,
Epinose, Castinago, John Antony Vosino, the count de Montelon, the
marquis de Betonde, the marquis de l'Estelle, the son to the count
of Consege, and others of renown. No one knew what became of the
duke du Traict,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> who was of their company. The viceroy of Naples
saved himself by flight, until he gained the seashore, and embarked
for Naples. The marquis de la Padulla and the count del Popolo made
good a retreat before the end of the conflict, with eleven or twelve
hundred horse, as well men at arms as light cavalry, and from sixteen
to seventeen-hundred infantry, the remains of their army, and saved
themselves as well as they could.</p>

<p>Numbers of Frenchmen were doubtless slain, for the Spaniards fought
with the utmost bravery; and when the french men at arms returning from
the pursuit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> passed over the field of battle, the wounded laid hands
on any swords near them, and, in the miserable state they were in on
the ground, cut the legs of the horses the French were mounted on.</p>

<p>Pope Julius was at Rome when news of this event was brought him. God
knows how he bore it, for he had been a very great sufferer in that
battle. The instant he heard it, he would have set off without delay,
fearing that the French would follow up their victory, and come to seek
him even in Rome.</p>

<p>After this defeat, the illustrious and gallant duke of Nemours, having
perceived a small body of the enemy that had not dispersed, like a
magnanimous prince, but too unmindful of the signal victory God had
just given him, required of the nobles and captains around him, that
they would be pleased to march with him and drive them away. Some of
them who, from long experience, knew the uncertainty of the chances of
war, remonstrated with him on being too adventurous, and that he should
remain satisfied with the success he had gained. Notwithstanding the
truth of these remonstrances, he persisted in his reso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>lution, and said
aloud, 'Let all who love me, follow me.' Upon this, the lord d'Alegre,
his son, Maugeron, the bastard of Cliete, seeing him thus determined
and already advancing followed him.</p>

<p>The duke of Nemours was the first to attack this body of the enemy,
who were greatly superior in number; and the gallant prince performed
such feats of arms as astonished them, and cleared all around his horse
with such rapid and mortal blows that none dared approach him. It was
a grand sight to view so young a man displaying such extraordinary
courage. The enemy, observing how few the French were, and that no
reinforcements were coming to them, recovered their courage and
surrounded the young hero. They first killed his horse, and then fell
upon him with battle-axes, pikes, and every sort of weapon, that he,
and all his companions, died a glorious death.</p>

<p>This was a most heavy loss to France, for he was a magnanimous prince,
worthy to be placed on a triumphant throne in a temple of brave men.
His liberality and frankness had gained him the love of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> army, who
would have followed him any where, even without pay,&mdash;and within four
months he had gained three decisive battles.</p>

<p>When this melancholy event was known, the lord de la Palisse and other
captains hastened to revenge his loss, and put to death the whole body
of the enemy that had slain the duke, the lord d'Alegre and the others,
without suffering one to escape. They thence marched to besiege the
city of Ravenna, which they took by storm, killed the greater part of
the inhabitants, and plundered the town: there was much confusion,
for it was almost entirely destroyed. When this was done, the french
returned to the field of the late battle, to raise the bodies of
the duke of Nemours and the other lords, to give them an honourable
interment in sacred ground. The body of that most noble prince and
viceroy of Italy, was carried in mournful triumph to Milan, from the
ground where he had fallen, to be magnificently interred becoming so
great a prince.</p>

<p>The body of the duke of Nemours arrived at Milan the 26th of April,
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the year 1412, preceded by all the prisoners taken at the battle
of Ravenna. The banners, guidons, and standards the French had so
valiantly conquered, as well from the Italians as from the Venetians
and Spaniards, and of the different lords who had fallen in this
battle, were borne before him, which added joy intermixed with
grief at this mournful interment. Great order was observed in the
procession,&mdash;and it was a triumphantly melancholy spectacle. The nobles
and captains were in deep mourning,&mdash;and there was no heart so hard
not to weep on seeing his body thus carried untimely to the grave. His
pages and attendants led his horses of parade and for war: his helmet
and victorious sword, as lieutenant general for the king, were borne
before the body. In short, those of his army who attended the funeral
were loud in their lamentations; for they had always found him liberal
and courteous, and never sparing of his own personal efforts in war.</p>

<p>The principal inhabitants and churchmen of Milan came out to meet the
body, dressed in mourning cloaks and hoods, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> a blaze of lighted
torches, on which were the arms of the deceased emblazoned. The body,
surrounded by two hundred of the choicest lances in the army and a
numerous escort of infantry, was conducted, with great pomp of grief,
to the cathedral, where a most solemn service was performed for the
repose of his soul.</p>

<p>Think how great must have been the sorrow of the king and queen, when
they heard of this sad event at Blois, for they loved him as if he had
been their own child; and I can assert for truth, that those who had
never seen him bewailed his loss, on the reports they had heard of his
uncommon virtues and gallantry. May God receive his soul!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE FRENCH FROM ITALY, THE SWISS TAKE THE TOWN OF
MILAN AND OTHER PLACES HELD BY THE KING OF FRANCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">After</span> this battle of Ravenna, where, as well as in the preceding ones,
great quantities of human blood were shed, principally of the Italians
and their allies,&mdash;but also of the French, and of some of the noblest
families, by which many ladies and damsels in France became widows and
orphans. The generals, or at least those who had the management of
the finances for the army, imagined that, by the happy event of this
battle, all Italy was subdued, as far as Rome, if not farther, and
disbanded great bodies of infantry at the very time when they should
have sought reinforcements, to garrison the towns and castles that had
been lately conquered.</p>

<p>When this conduct was noticed by certain bloodsuckers and turbulent
spirits, they collected troops in divers parts, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> endeavour to regain
honour by attacking the French; for, seeing them dispersed in their
garrisons, they were aware that courage, when disunited, is not so
much to be dreaded as when in a collective body. The holy father the
pope, smarting from the losses he had suffered from the French, three
times excited the Swiss-cantons to rise in arms against them, for they
had of late been neglected by the king of France. They chiefly depend,
for their maintenance, on pensions from kings and princes,&mdash;and the
pope having made the bishop of Sion a cardinal, he was an active and
able tool, by his public preachings and intrigues, to prevail on them
to comply with the wishes of his holiness. Maximilian also, having
turned his coat, was to allow them an entrance to Italy through his
territories of the Veronese and elsewhere. The Spaniards likewise
assembled from various parts of Italy; and they all advanced toward
Milan, whence the government had been withdrawn to France, so that the
poor Milanese were in despair, and knew not how to act. However, the
French having left them, they, as usual, fell in with the strongest,
and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> enemy was admitted into the town. The castle was held by the
French, under the command of the lord de Louvain; and other castles
were also in their possession: that of Brescia was held by the lord
d'Aubigny.</p>

<p>When the French were returning from Italy, a sharp skirmish took place
at a bridge near to Pavia, between a small body of french adventurers
and the enemy, and they were inhumanly treated by the townsmen. Among
others of their villanous acts, I shall mention one. A Frenchman,
unable to keep up with the rest, was met by an inhabitant of Pavia,
who said to him, 'My friend, I love the french nation: come, I beg of
you, to my house, and I will save you from being killed.' The poor
adventurer, confiding in his fair words, followed him; but he was no
sooner within his doors than he treated him most brutally, cut off his
private parts, and thrust him into the street in his shirt, bawling
aloud, 'Here is another Frenchman!' on which numbers rushed out of
their doors, and hacked him to pieces with their swords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another inhabitant of Pavia who had even devoured the heart
of a Frenchman, by way of revenge.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that all the evils that have befallen Italy have been
caused by their wickedness, and infamous practices similar to those of
Sodom and Gomorrah. The air would be infected, were I to recite them.
May God amend them, and all others! On the other hand, the French have
a shameful custom (which was increased when in Italy) of blaspheming
our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, and our Lady, with divers indecent
oaths, in which they seem to take pleasure. God may, perhaps, have been
angered by such detestable blasphemies, and by that great vanity with
which the French are always filled, and suffered them to experience the
late unfortunate reverses, to show that from Him alone come victories
and good fortune.</p>

<p>The French, on leaving Italy, were in a great alarm,&mdash;and they were so
rejoiced when returned to France, they attributed it to the favour of
Heaven. Such are the chances of this world.</p>

<p>In this year of 1512, pope Julius, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>turning evil for good, was
violently animated against the French; and having partly accomplished
his wish of being the chief cause of their expulsion from Italy, died
at Rome in the ninth year of his pontificate. May God pardon him!</p>

<p>About this time, a truce was concluded between the kings of France and
of Arragon, for a certain space of time. Leo X. was now the reigning
pope: he was consecrated at Rome the successor of pope Julius II.
Leo was a native of Florence, of very wealthy, and renowned parents.
His father was Lorenzo de Medici, to whose family Louis XI., king of
France, had granted permission to add the three flowers de luce to
their armorial bearings<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>OF THE WAR IN GUIENNE.&mdash;THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS SUCCOURS TO THE
KING OF NAVARRE.&mdash;THE KING OF ENGLAND MAKES PREPARATIONS TO INVADE
FRANCE.&mdash;A SEA-FIGHT BETWEEN TWO LARGE ENGLISH AND FRENCH SHIPS.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not long before a war broke out in Guienne, or rather in
Navarre; which kingdom the king of Arragon had entered, and taken the
town of Pampeluna, with others belonging to the king of Navarre, under
pretence of being heir to that crown in right of his wife, sister to
the late duke of Nemours count of Foix, slain after the battle of
Ravenna.</p>

<p>The good king of Navarre<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, in consequence, demanded succour from
the king of France, to recover the places he had lost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Louis XII.,
considering how faithful an ally he had always been, ordered a large
body of men at arms and infantry to his assistance, under the command
of the duke of Longueville and Dunois. This war was very expensive
to the king of France, for the army remained long without striking a
blow. In addition to this, the English, excited by the king of Arragon,
as well as by a desire to regain Guienne, which they claimed as an
inheritance, made a landing near to Roncevaux and St John Pied du
Port,&mdash;but not being able to effect a junction with the Spaniards, they
returned<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 1513, Henry king of England, son to king Henry VII. who,
by the aid of Charles VIII. king of France, succeeded peaceably to the
crown of England after the death of Richard of York, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> of being
grateful, for such services, to the king of France, although his late
father had charged him, on his deathbed, to do nothing against that
king, if he wished to prosper, instantly on the death of his father
acted directly contrary. King Henry, equally eager with his subjects
to invade France, sent an embassy to the lady Margaret, governess
of Flanders, to obtain armour, stores, and artillery, particularly
thirteen large cannons, which he had ordered to be cast in Flanders.
These articles were immediately delivered, in return for a large sum
of angels that remained behind,&mdash;for it had been long since they had
circulated in any other country than their own.</p>

<p>A secret treaty was, at the same time, concluded between Henry and
the archduke,&mdash;which having secured him the aid of the Flemings,
he continued to make his preparations for the invasion of France
without interruption. He sent his fleet, under the command of the lord
admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> to cruize on the coasts of Brittany, who was himself on
board a vessel of prodigious size.</p>

<p>The french saw this armament with sorrow, for they had not a fleet able
to cope with it; but a valiant sea-captain, named Primaugay, embarked
on board a large ship called La Cordeliere, which the queen of France
had lately built at an immense expense. He put to sea, and boldly
attacked the english admiral in the great ship called The Regent, when
a bloody combat took place. After some time, the Cordeliere set the
Regent on fire, which having gained the powder-magazine, she blew up,
with all within her.</p>

<p>Primaugay, seeing it impossible to save his ship, as they were grappled
together, leapt into the sea, armed as he was, and perished: it was a
pity, for he was a bold and enterprising man<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>These two large ships were burnt; but the rest of the fleet returned in
safety to England, to report the unfortunate news to the king, who was
much vexed thereat, and not without reason.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE KING OF ENGLAND DISEMBARKS WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY AT CALAIS.&mdash;THE
FRENCH ARE DEFEATED BY THE SWISS, AT NOVARA.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">When</span> the king of England had completed his preparations, he put to
sea with his army, disembarked at Calais, and thence, with part of
it, marched strait for Flanders. Had he then been attacked, the
perplexities that ensued afterwards would have been avoided.</p>

<p>At the same time, the king of France had collected an army for the
recovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> the Milanese, under the command of the lord de la
Trimouille, Jean Jacques de Trivulce, sir Robert de la Marche, the lord
of Albany and others,&mdash;but the lord de la Trimouille was commander in
chief.</p>

<p>This army crossed the Alps, and entered Piedmont, where it halted for
the arrival of the rear and baggage, and then pushed forward toward
Novara, in which place was a body of Swiss. The French, supposing them
not very numerous, determined to attack them, which they did; but the
evening before, a very large reinforcement of Swiss had joined their
countrymen in Novara, which the French were ignorant of. A battle,
however, ensued, when the French defeated the van of the enemy; but
such numbers of Swiss now poured in on all sides, the French were
thunderstruck, and hastily retreated to Turin: some, however, of their
infantry, stood their ground, and died valiantly,&mdash;and the son of the
lord de la Marche shone pre-eminent for his valour.</p>

<p>The Swiss gained a considerable park of artillery, which the lord de la
Marche had brought thither, and great part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> baggage. The king
of France, on hearing of this event, ordered the remainder of the army
home, and sent part of it into Guienne, where the illustrious lord of
Bourbon had the command of an army, with many nobles and able captains
under him, to carry on the war in Navarre. He had there a fine camp,
and a variety of skirmishes took place on both sides.</p>

<p>The king afterwards sent the next heir to the crown, the duke of
Valois and count of Angoulême, accompanied by numbers of gentlemen,
to take the command of this army and camp, where they remained a long
time,&mdash;but nothing of importance was done, and they returned to France.
The king then sent them into Picardy to oppose the English, who were
advancing toward Therouenne. The lord de Longueville died immediately
on his return from Guienne.</p>

<p>In this year, there was an appearance in the heavens, visible in
Piedmont, of three suns, three moons, with various figures of circles
and bows, of different colours, and a white cross in the center. These
were terrible presages,&mdash;and I believe that it was a year of wonders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time, the king sent the lord de la Trimouille into
Swisserland; but the cantons would not agree to any conference until
they should receive a certain sum of money, which was paid them. The
conferences now took place; and the lord de la Trimouille staid long
among them, giving great gifts, in hopes to gain them over to the
interests of France; but after they had received large sums of money,
they dismissed him. He returned through Burgundy, to have some of the
towns of that province put into a good state of defence, to resist the
Swiss, who had determined to attack them.</p>

<p>The Swiss, in consequence of the resolutions they had formed, entered
Burgundy, and committed great destruction wherever they passed. By
rapid marches, they came before Dijon, into which the lord de la
Trimouille had thrown himself; but with the few men at arms and
infantry with him, it was impossible to resist such a deluge of Swiss.
However, he ordered as many things as could be carried away or drove
off, to be brought into Dijon.</p>

<p>The Swiss, on coming before Dijon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> saluted the town with a large train
of artillery, that battered and damaged the walls and houses; but the
lord de la Trimouille, being well advised, held a parley with some of
the Swiss leaders, and agreed to pay them down one hundred thousand
golden crowns, on their marching back into Swisserland, without doing
more damages to the country, which was executed.</p>

<p>A BODY OF FRENCH ON THEIR RETURN FROM VICTUALLING THEROUENNE, BESIEGED
BY THE ENGLISH AND HAINAULTERS, ARE ATTACKED AND PUT TO FLIGHT.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> king of France marched in person to Picardy, and advanced as far as
Amiens, where he was magnificently received by those of the town and
country. Thence he sent the duke of Valois, as his lieutenant-general,
to command the camp against the English, and to order whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
measures he should think advisable for the victualling of Therouenne.</p>

<p>This town was then besieged by the king of the Romans, the king of
England, and a number of flemish lords, and particularly by a body of
Hainaulters, who had posted themselves in a fort near the town, and
thence battered it with heavy artillery. The garrison and townsmen
defended the place valiantly, but they were in the utmost distress
from want of provision, and a convoy was ordered to supply their
necessities, under the command of the lord de Longueville.</p>

<p>He executed this order punctually by throwing in all his supplies; but
on his retreat, he fell unexpectedly into an ambuscade,&mdash;for his men,
not suspecting any such stratagem, were marching very disorderly, and
amusing themselves by playing in the fields. On the enemy sallying
from their ambush, the French were panicstruck, and began to fly,
notwithstanding all attempts of their officers to prevent them. In
consequence, the lord de Longueville, the captain Bayard, the lord de
Bussy, and many more captains of renown were made priso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ners, some of
whom were carried to England, and their liberty set at a very high
ransom<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>During this time, the king of France sent orders to the governor
of Paris to have all the companies of tradesmen, and of other
descriptions, mustered. This was done, and several companies were
richly accoutred, well armed, and in uniforms. The numbers were found
to be very great, according to the report made by the commissaries who
had been sent thither for this purpose.</p>

<p>THE TOWNS OF THEROUENNE AND TOURNAY SURRENDER TO THE ENGLISH ON
CAPITULATION.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">To</span> return to the wars of the English in Picardy:&mdash;they were long
encamped before Therouenne, and made several attacks on it; but those
within the town showed good courage, and defended it valiantly: at
length provision again failed them, and they were forced to capitulate
for its surrender. The enemy entered Therouenne, but did not keep the
promises they had made; for they had no sooner gained admission than
they began to ill-treat and plunder the poor inhabitants, insomuch that
they were obliged to seek out another place for a habitation, which was
great pity; but this did not satisfy the enemy, for they burnt part of
the town, and threw down the walls to the ground.</p>

<p>We must not be astonished that the English so boldly invaded France,
particularly Picardy, considering the evident good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> understanding that
subsisted between them and the Flemings, who at this day raise their
hands and tell those of Tournay that they have never changed sides,
notwithstanding they had settled the chapter <i>de Venditionibus</i>,
before the English would embark. This was not handsomely done in
them, considering they had a resident lord,&mdash;and they have derogated
shamefully from their former engagements: should they, therefore, find
themselves the worse for it, they have only themselves to thank.</p>

<p>Shortly after the English had gained Therouenne by capitulation, they
advanced before Tournay, which was surrendered to them by the principal
inhabitants, according to an agreement among themselves, without
striking a blow<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>The king of England and the king of the Romans, after these conquests,
returned to their own countries, leaving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> garrison in Tournay. The
king of France likewise quitted Picardy, with his queen, and went to
Blois.</p>

<p>While the war was carrying on in Picardy, and a little before the
siege of Therouenne, an engagement at sea took place between Pregent,
a french captain, and the lord Howard, lord-admiral of England, on
the 22nd and 25th days of April. Pregent, thinking to join the french
fleet in Brest harbour, was met at sea, on the vigil of St George's
day, by a fleet of forty or fifty sail, and was instantly attacked
by two galeasses and four or five other vessels. The combat lasted
two hours, with great slaughter on both sides; but at length the
English were forced to retire, with the loss of two vessels sunk. On
the Monday following, which was the feast of St Mark, Pregent and his
fleet fell in again with that of the English, amounting to twenty or
thirty vessels, and about thirty large boats. The galley of Pregent was
attacked by two galeasses and three ships, but he fought well,&mdash;and
all on board the first galeass were killed by pikes, or drove into the
sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> excepting two prisoners, one of whom was thrown overboard.</p>

<p>In this combat, sir Edward Howard was killed, whose body was embalmed
to carry to England for interment<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. The captains of the other ships,
seeing that these five vessels had not made any impression on the
galley of Pregent, whom they had courageously attacked, held a council,
and afterwards made sail, leaving the sea open to Pregent. A large
fleet had been collected at Honnefleur, to attack the king of England
as he crossed the channel, and cut off his return; but when they were
at sea, a violent storm arose that separated this fleet, and some of
the vessels were sunk.</p>

<p>The winter of this year was very long and severe, so that the Seine and
other rivers were frozen hard enough for carriages to pass over them
with safety; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> the thaw came, numbers of houses and mills were
destroyed by the floods.</p>

<p>About this time, news was brought that the Swiss had intentions
of again entering Burgundy, when the king ordered thither the
lord of Bourbon with a large force of men at arms, infantry,
and artillery,&mdash;but the Swiss did not come. This same year, the
garrisons that had guarded different places in Italy returned to
France, in consequence of the treaty concluded with the Swiss before
Dijon,&mdash;namely, those from the castle of Milan; the lord of Aubigny,
his lance on his thigh, with his garrison, from the castle of Brescia.
When these garrisons marched away, the Spaniards took possession of the
castles, which the Venetians thought had been done for them; but when
the Spaniards had established themselves securely, they chaunted to the
Venetians the Evangile des Vierges. Such are the chances of war.</p>

<p>OF THE DEATH AND INTERMENT OF THE MOST CHRISTIAN QUEEN OF FRANCE, ANNE
OF BRITTANY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of the arrival of the above unfortunate intelligence,
the most noble queen of France, Anne duchess of Brittany, &amp;c. lay
dangerously ill at the castle of Blois. This was on the 2d day of
January,&mdash;and her illness so much increased that the good lady, on
Monday the 9th instant, departed this life, most devoutly, in the faith
of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, our sovereign Lord, to whom she most humbly
resigned her soul. Great lamentations and grief were shown for this
loss. When the body had been embalmed, it was put into a rich coffin,
and carried, with an immense number of lighted torches, from Blois to
the abbey of St Denis, where it was interred with the usual honours
due to her rank, and followed with the tears of all her officers and
attendants. The funeral service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> was solemn and magnificent, becoming
such a lady, whose soul may God pardon!</p>

<p>In the month of April of this year 1513, and just before Easter, a
truce was proclaimed in Paris between the kings of France and of
Arragon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE KING OF FRANCE MARRIES THE PRINCESS MARY, SISTER TO KING HENRY OF
ENGLAND.&mdash;FRANCIS DUKE OF VALOIS AND COUNT OF ANGOULESME MARRIES THE
PRINCESS CLAUDE, DAUGHTER TO THE KING OF FRANCE.&mdash;THE NEW QUEEN MAKES
HER PUBLIC ENTRY INTO FRANCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">After</span> the funeral of the late queen of France, the king came to Paris,
and was lodged at the hôtel of the Tournelles, and would not that any
one should appear in his presence but in mourning. He sent for his
two daughters, the princesses Claude and Renée, who were conducted to
him from Blois by madame d'Angoulême, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> shortly after summoned the
princes and great barons of his realm to a council on the present state
of affairs, and respecting a peace with England. In consequence of what
had been resolved on in this council, the king sent, as his ambassadors
to king Henry, the governor of Normandy, the president of Rouen, and
the lord Longueville, then a prisoner of war in England, was added to
them, to treat of a peace.</p>

<p>While this was passing, the king was taken very ill at the castle
of Vincennes, and had ordered, for his recovery, that 'O Salutaris
Hostia,' should be chaunted daily in all the churches of France, at the
elevation of the holy sacrament, which had been of the utmost benefit
to him. On his recovery, the king went thence to St Germain en Laye, to
recreate himself, and to temper the melancholy of his mourning; for it
was a pleasant country, interspersed with woods and dales, and full of
game.</p>

<p>Much public business was transacted during the king's stay at Saint
Germain; and a marriage was concluded between the duke of Valois, count
of Angoulême, and the princess Claude. They were mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ried in their
mourning, in the chapel of the castle, in the presence of the king, the
princes of the blood, and many others of high rank, on the 18th of May,
in the year 1513.</p>

<p>About this period, and before the king had quitted St Germain en Laye,
his ambassadors sent him intelligence of their having concluded a peace
with England, on condition of his marrying the princess Mary. King
Henry sent ambassadors to Paris, to confirm the marriage between king
Louis and his sister, and to ratify the treaty of peace that had been
agreed on between the two kingdoms, which was now publicly proclaimed
in both realms.</p>

<p>On Monday the 16th of August, in this year, a grand procession was
made from the great hall of the palace, with trumpets and clarions,
when the herald, called Mont-joye, proclaimed a magnificent tournament
to be holden at Paris, by the duke of Valois, Brittany, and count of
Angoulême, to which he invited all princes, lords, and gentlemen to
assist. It was about this time that the princess Mary was escorted to
France by many of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> nobles of England, in company with the
lords of France who had gone thither to attend on her. The king left
Paris, with his court, and went as far as Abbeville to meet the new
queen, where she arrived on the 8th of October, and made her public
entry very triumphantly, attended by the duke of Valois and numbers of
nobles, as well English as French, all most richly dressed, with large
golden chains, especially the English. The queen was most handsomely
attired, and seated in a brilliant car: in short, the whole was a
beautiful sight. She was preceded by a body of two hundred english
archers, gallantly accoutred, with their bows in hand, and quivers full
of arrows.</p>

<p>The king, hearing of her coming, mounted his horse, and, attended
by his nobles, rode out into the plain, under pretence of hawking,
but it was to meet her; and on his approaching her, he kissed her on
horseback, paying her many fair compliments, as he knew well how to do.
Her reception in Abbeville was most honourable,&mdash;and the inhabitants
exerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> themselves who should surpass the other in testifying their
joy at her arrival.</p>

<p>On the morrow, the feast of St Denis, the king of France was married
to the princess Mary of England. She was most magnificently dressed,
with an immense quantity of diamonds and precious stones. A singular
banquet succeeded, with a great variety of all sorts of amusements.
Having staid a few days in Abbeville to solace themselves, they set out
for Paris; and through the towns of Picardy they passed, the greatest
honours were paid them. In every town, the queen gave liberty to the
prisoners, by the king's command. On their arrival at St Denis, the
ceremony of the queen's coronation took place, which was very splendid,
and numerously attended by archbishops, bishops, and nobility.</p>

<p>Monday, the 6th of November, the queen made her triumphant entry into
the city of Paris&mdash;the clergy, courts of parliament, of exchequer, &amp;c.
and all the municipal officers, with crowds of people, having gone out
in procession to meet her. She was seated on a rich litter, adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
with precious stones, and escorted by the duke of Valois, the lord of
Alençon, the lord of Bourbon, the lord of Vendôme, his brother the lord
Francis, Louis de Nevers, with other great lords, as well of England
as of France, prelates and churchmen. Her litter was followed by those
of the princess Claude, duchess of Valois, madame d'Angoulême, madame
de Vendôme, madame de Nevers, and other princesses of both kingdoms.
Thus was she conducted to the church of Nôtre Dame, and took the usual
oaths: she thence proceeded to the royal palace, where a most splendid
banquet was provided. The king and queen lay that night at the royal
palace, which served to shorten his days.</p>

<p>OF THE TILTS PERFORMED AT PARIS.&mdash;THE DEATH AND INTERMENT OF LOUIS
XII. KING OF FRANCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, the king and queen went to the Tournelles, to see the
tournaments, that had been before proclaimed. At the entrance of the
lists was a triumphal arch surmounted with the shields of arms of the
king and queen: below them were the emblazoned shields of the lords and
princes, the tenants and defendants of the lists. The duke of Valois
was the chief tenant, with his assistants,&mdash;and many gallant courses
were ran with lances, to the advantage of some, and to the loss of
others. In short, it was a handsome spectacle, and all in compliment
to, and for the love of, queen Mary; but her popularity would not have
lasted long, for although the poor people were already heavily taxed,
yet the king intended, had he lived longer, to have greatly increased
the taxes.</p>

<p>After these justs and tourneys, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> king carried the queen to St
Germain en Laye, where they spent some time, leading as joyous a life
as he was able. He thence returned to his palace of the Tournelles
at Paris, and was taken so dangerously ill that he made preparations
becoming a good Christian, and rendered his soul to God on the 1st
day of January, in the year 1514. His body was aromatically embalmed,
and lay in state some days at the Tournelles, where every body went
to see it who pleased. The usual ceremonies on such occasions were
then performed, but it would be tiresome to detail them. Some days
after, the body was carried to the church of Nôtre Dame, and placed in
a chapel that had been purposely erected in the choir,&mdash;and a solemn
service was performed by the bishop of Paris. The next day it was borne
to a cross near to St Denis, where the abbot and his monks of St Denis
met it, and was, by them, interred with great pomp, amidst the tears
of his officers and domestics. He was buried beside his queen, Anne of
Brittany. May God receive their souls! The principal mourners were the
lord of Alen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>çon, the lord of Bourbon, the lord of Vendôme, and other
princes and great lords.</p>

<p>It is of some moment when a king or great prince dies, who may,
perhaps, have caused the deaths of numbers of human creatures like
themselves; for I believe that in the other world they will have enough
to do, more especially respecting this circumstance, that a poor
man, with six or seven small children, not worth twenty sols in the
world, shall be taxed from ten to twenty sols, and when the collector
shall come to receive the tax, finding the man worth nothing, and
without means of raising the money, he commits him to prison, where he
languishes out his days. Now I would like to have shown any written law
for this injustice; but no one will attempt so to do, because every one
is eager to push himself forward in this world. May God assist the poor
people!</p>

<p>FRANCIS I. KING OF FRANCE, IS CONSECRATED AT RHEIMS.&mdash;HE MAKES HIS
PUBLIC ENTRY INTO PARIS.&mdash;HE LEAVES FRANCE TO ATTACK THE SWISS, IN THE
MILANESE, WHO HAVE TAKEN POSSESSION OF THAT DUCHY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of Louis XII. Francis, the first of the name, succeeded
him on the throne as the fifty-seventh king of France. He set out from
Paris, to be consecrated king in the cathedral of Rheims, according to
the custom of his ancestors kings of France, and was there anointed
with the holy oil on the 25th day of January, in the year 1514. The
twelve peers of France, or their substitutes, were present exercising
their functions in the usual manner on such occasions.</p>

<p>Madame d'Angoulême, the king's mother, was present at the ceremony,
accompanied by madame de Bourbon, madame de Vendôme, and other ladies
and damsels. The king went from Rheims to be crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> at St Denis,
and, on his return, made triumphal public entries into Laon, Noyon,
Compiègne, Senlis, and other towns. He continued his way toward Paris,
very grandly attended, and made the most brilliant public entry into
that city that had ever been seen. The accoutrements and trappings
of the horses were of wrought silver, with frized cloth of gold;
and, to sum up the whole in few words, the lords and gentlemen, with
their horses, were covered with cloth of gold: some had their dresses
interwrought with solid silver.</p>

<p>The king entered in triumph, dressed magnificently: the trappings of
his horse were of worked silver, and his attendants equipped in cloth
of silver brocade. He went, as usual, to the royal palace, where a
sumptuous banquet had been prepared, with a numerous band of trumpets
and clarions; after which, a grand tournament was held in the rue St
Antoine, when the king acquitted himself most gallantly.</p>

<p>A treaty was concluded between the king of France and the archduke,
and a marriage agreed on between the archduke and the princess Renée,
daughter to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> late king, Louis XII. by the count of Nassau, and
other ambassadors dispatched for this purpose. The count of Nassau
was also betrothed to the daughter of the prince of Orange, whom
he afterwards married. At this time, the duke of Bourbon was made
constable of France,&mdash;and while the king remained at Paris, the duke of
Suffolk espoused the queen-dowager of France, sister to Henry king of
England. That king had sent the duke of Suffolk to France,&mdash;and when he
carried his queen to England, he was grandly accompanied by the highest
of the nobility. Thus was confirmed the peace between the two kingdoms.
At this time also, the king of France sent to seek Pedro de Navarre, a
prisoner of war, whom he set at liberty, gave him many rich gifts, and
the command of a large body of men.</p>

<p>When all these marriages, and other matters, had been concluded, the
king celebrated the feast of Easter in Paris, and then, with his queen
and court, went by water as far as Montereau-faut-Yonne. He thence
went, on the 1st of May, to a small castle called Egreville, where
were some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> justings, and proceeded to Montargis and Briare, where he
embarked on the Loire for Amboise. He made a public entry into all the
towns he passed,&mdash;namely, Mehun, Montereau, Montargis, Blois, Amboise,
and other small towns, where every honour was paid him.</p>

<p>While he was hunting at Amboise, a thorn pierced his leg, through
boot and hose, and gave him such pain that he was for a time very
ill.&mdash;During his residence at Amboise, the lord de Lorraine was married
to mademoiselle de Bourbon, sister to the constable of France. Great
feasts were displayed on the occasion, and the court of the donjon of
the castle was covered with an awning of cloth, to keep off the rays of
the sun. In the evening of that day were great maskings and mummeries,
with morris-dancers richly dressed, and divers pastimes.</p>

<p>These feastings being over, the king departed, very early one morning,
for Romorantin<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, where he was also grandly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> entertained by the lady,
his mother. While with her, he received intelligence that the Swiss
had entered Dauphiny, near to Briançon, and burnt a village close to
Château Dauphin; on which, he took a hasty leave of his mother, and
set off suddenly for Bourges, where he made a public entry. The king
departed, on the morrow, in haste, for Moulins, where the duchess
of Bourbon handsomely received him,&mdash;and his entry was splendid for
so small a town; for there were triumphant cars, filled with the
handsomest ladies of the country, representations of ships and wild
beasts, mounted by the beauties of the town, who preceded the king on
his entry. The king left Moulins for Lyon, where a most magnificent
entry was prepared for him. He gave there his final orders respecting
the provision and stores, which were in a state of forwardness to
be transported over the Alps, for the prosecution of the war in the
Milanese. During his absence in Italy, he nominated his mother, the
duchess of Anjou and Maine, countess of Angoulême, &amp;c. regent of the
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after, the king departed from Lyon, and went to Grenoble, where
he made a handsome entry, and staid there until his preparations should
be completed. About this period, the young son of Frederic late king
of Naples died: he had already commenced a warlike career; and had he
lived I believe he would have made a figure as a warrior, for he was
very courageous and virtuous.</p>

<p>When the king set out from Grenoble, he passed through Embrun, although
his army, or the greater part, had taken the road through the small
town of Duissant, for there had been formed stores of provision on all
that line of march. The king halted at Guillestre<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, and afterward at
Saint Paul<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and then traversed a road so bad that it was thought
no man had ever before attempted it. Great difficulties attended this
march, and the poor infantry suffered much; for as the artillery was to
pass this road, the cannon were dismounted, and dragged by men over the
rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time, the pope had sent fifteen hundred horse, well
appointed, under the command of Prospero Colonna, to join the forces
of Maximilian, in the hope of surprising the king before he could pass
the mountains; but Prospero, ignorant how near he was to the French,
or that they had succeeded in passing the Alps, had halted at a town
in Piedmont called Villa-franca<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. Of this circumstance, a peasant
of that country had informed one of the king's gentlemen, named the
lord de la Morette, and that, as Prospero was quite unsuspicious of
the French being so near, it would be easy to surprise him. The lord
de la Morette lost no time to carry this news to the marshal de la
Palisse, the lord d'Aubigny, the lord d'Imbercourt, Bayard and others,
who all instantly agreed to follow the lord d'Imbercourt in the
attempt to surprise Colonna. He had sent forward one of his archers
to reconnoitre, who reported, that as Colonna and his men were just
sitting down to dinner, and entirely off their guard, an immediate
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>tack would be necessary: d'Imbercourt sent, therefore, to hasten the
march of La Palisse and the others.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, d'Imbercourt boldly advanced to enter Villa
Franca,&mdash;when as his trumpet was within the gates, and had sounded his
charge, his horse's neck was inclosed within them; but the men at arms
came to his relief, by crossing their lances over the horse, and put to
death all who had opposed them at the gate.</p>

<p>They galloped up the streets, shouting out 'France, France!' and
advanced to where Colonna was at dinner: a sharp conflict now took
place,&mdash;but the lord de la Palisse and the others arrived, who soon
ended it, by making Colonna prisoner, and slaying great numbers of his
men. All his baggage was pillaged, and very many fine horses gained
that were in the stables of the town. Prospero Colonna was carried,
with the other prisoners, to the king of France, and thence sent into
confinement at the castle of Montagu, belonging to the lord de la
Palisse.</p>

<p>THE KING OF FRANCE PURSUES THE SWISS WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY.&mdash;THE TOWN
AND CASTLE OF NOVARA SURRENDER TO THE KING.</p></blockquote>


<p>The pope, when he heard of the defeat of Prospero Colonna and his army,
and that he was sent prisoner to France, was very much surprised, and
not without reason; for he never had imagined that the king of France
would attempt to cross the Alps where he had, and for some time would
not believe it.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> Swiss cantoned at Susa, Villaine, Rivoli and other parts, hearing
of what had passed at Villa-franca, retreated toward Milan followed by
the French as far as Turin, whence the duke of Savoy came out to meet
the king, and gave him a handsome reception. The king, having received
from the duke of Savoy five large pieces of artillery, continued
his pursuit of the Swiss who had passed the Po in an extraordinary
hurry,&mdash;for they had no boats, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> any means but cords to drag their
artillery and baggage over, with which they marched day and night.</p>

<p>They burnt the castle of Chivazzo, and part of that small town,
belonging to the duke of Savoy, which lay on their line of march,
killing many of the inhabitants and plundering the town, because they
would not afford them provision, nor allow them a passage through
Chivazzo. Some of the Swiss were slain, that had remained behind to
pillage.</p>

<p>In this interval, the lord de Prie, with a body of Genoese, arrived at
Alexandria and other towns, which he sacked, although their inhabitants
had fled,&mdash;but they were deserving of punishment for the many tricks
they had before played the French.</p>

<p>The french army kept pursuing the Swiss, who seemed inclined to march
to Jurea<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, but, turning short, entered Novara. The king arrived with
his army at Vercelli<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, where it was rumoured that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> an agreement
would take place between the king and Swiss. The lord bastard of
Savoy and the lord de Lautrec, with others, were charged with this
commission; but notwithstanding this, the king continued his march
after the Swiss, who had quitted Novara, and taken the road to Milan.
He was now joined by a considerable reinforcement of Lansquenets,
called The Black Band<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, very well equipped. The king advanced to
Novara, which was instantly assaulted by Pedro de Navarre and others,
and surrendered to the king's obedience.</p>

<p>In the absence of the king, his queen was brought to bed, at Amboise,
of a fair daughter, who was christened Louisa,&mdash;and soon afterwards,
her portrait was sent to him, while engaged in his Italian campaign.</p>

<p>The surrender of the town and castle of Novara saved them from pillage,
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> the king's commands,&mdash;who pursuing his march toward Milan, went
to Bufalora. Here the agreement between the king and Swiss was made
public, which had been accomplished by means of a large sum of money
paid down, according to a promise made them by the king. The Swiss, in
consequence, swore fidelity to him, and signed the treaty,&mdash;but which
they did not keep, notwithstanding their oaths and engagements, but
falsified both.</p>

<p>THE KING OF FRANCE DEFEATS THE SWISS ARMY AT MARIGNANO<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, ON THE
FEAST-DAY OF THE EXALTATION OF THE CROSS.&mdash;OF THE CRUEL BATTLE AND
SLAUGHTER OF THE FRENCH AND SWISS.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> king of France, thinking that he had secured the Swiss by the
payment of the sum agreed on between them and the lord de Lautrec,
marched his army to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> Marignano, beyond Milan; but it was not long
before he found that he had miscalculated on their keeping the promises
they had made him. In the interval between the signing of the late
treaty and the payment of the money, the Swiss had resolved to surprise
the king's army,&mdash;induced thereto by the remonstrances and preachments
of the cardinal of Sion, who had corrupted them at the instigation of
the emperor Maximilian, and of the inhabitants of the Milanese, who
had given them corslets and other armour, together with the fairest
promises. The Swiss believing that they would be joined by every
Italian, and that, if successful, they might acquire territories of a
great extent in a fertile country, and be feared and redoubted by all
the world, caused them to act in the treacherous manner they did.</p>

<p>The king learning that the Swiss were turned against him, was much
mortified; for he concluded, that at that moment they were receiving
the money agreed on. However, like a hardy knight, he was not cast
down, but gave his orders for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> forming of his army, to receive the
enemy with the most advantage. While thus employed, news was brought
him that a large body of infantry, well armed had marched out of Milan,
to join the Swiss in the meditated attack against him. In fact, about
three or four o'clock in that afternoon, the Swiss advanced on the
king's army, but were received with such valour that many were more
inclined to seek for a retreat than to persevere in the combat.</p>

<p>The king, who commanded the main body, on seeing the Swiss advance,
charged them in person, attended by his gentlemen, and defeated one
band. The french volunteers now placed themselves in the position of
the Lansquenets, who had in part turned their backs; but they must not
be blamed for this, for they had before heard of the agreement made
with the Swiss, and, without any explanation, had been led on to an
unexpected battle, which made them believe that they were betrayed by
the king, who wanted to have them destroyed. But when they saw the
volunteers thus step boldly into their ranks, they recovered courage,
and fought with the utmost bravery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>The french volunteers did wonders; and although they were not numerous,
amounting to no more than two thousand, they defeated a band of Swiss
consisting of double their number. Great feats of arms were done at
this battle, with battle-axes, lances, and two-handed-swords, so that
for a long time it was doubtful on which side victory would remain.</p>

<p>The Swiss behaved with the utmost courage, and charged the main body
and reserve of the French with an impetuosity that astonished them,
in the hopes of succeeding as they had before done at Novara. The
artillery of the French was not asleep, and the Swiss made an attempt
to seize it, but were repulsed with much loss,&mdash;for not a cannon was
fired without killing numbers of them.</p>

<p>This battle lasted until the going down of the sun,&mdash;and both sides
fought as long as the dust and light allowed them to see each other.
Some, thinking to retire to their own camp, found themselves in that
of the enemy; but what caused great confusion was the Swiss shouting
out 'France, France!' and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> attacking the French. The night was not
long. The king was constantly with his men, giving them every sort of
encouragement, by words and example. He was particularly anxious about
his artillery, which was well guarded by a party of Lansquenets. Having
visited the different divisions of his army, he reposed himself in his
armour, on the carriage of a cannon; and I may with truth assert, that
if the king had not been present at this engagement the French would
have had more than enough to do.</p>

<p>On the morrow, the 14th of September, in the year 1515, and the feast
of the Exaltation of the Cross, the Swiss, enraged against the French,
advanced on them by day-break (notwithstanding their loss on the
preceding night had been more than they supposed) with an eagerness
as if they had been going to a dance, and made their charge with
valour and steadiness. The conflict was long and doubtful; but the
king's artillery, where he was in person, did the greatest service,
particularly on a strong body that kept firmly united until their
losses were so consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>able, the remainder turned their backs, and
fled for Milan. The other divisions of the Swiss made now little
resistance; and to make short of the matter, all that remained were put
to death, or taken prisoners; and had not the dust been great, fewer
would have escaped,&mdash;for it was so thick they could not see many yards
before them<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>The heat that day was very oppressive; and the king and his lords
suffered greatly from thirst, for there was no water near that was
pure,&mdash;for all the springs and streams were discoloured with blood, of
which, nevertheless, they were forced to drink; at length, some clear
water was brought them.</p>

<p>The king was as much rejoiced that the Swiss had renewed the battle, on
the following day, as a huntsman when he lays blinkes in the chace of a
stag. The Swiss left full sixteen thousand dead on the field, who did
not lose their lives like children, but as men of true courage; and all
the roads toward Milan and Como<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> were full of those who in their flight
had died of the wounds they had received in battle.</p>

<p>This was the first victory of king Francis I. and was very marvellous
it proved so great, considering how much he had been deceived in the
Swiss by their treaty some days prior to the combat. It is worthy of
remembrance,&mdash;for since the days of Julius Cæsar, this nation, so
valorous in war, never lost in battle so many as sixteen thousand men.
Louis XI. had defeated, when dauphin, a body of three or four thousand:
a duke of Milan had also conquered a body of two thousand, which
inclines me so much to exalt this victory of the king over enemies so
determined and numerous, for thirty-six thousand men had marched out of
Milan.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the combat, a reinforcement of Venetians arrived,
which the constable of Bourbon had gone to seek. The troops made all
diligence, were well accoutred and ready for battle; but they found the
Swiss defeated, and flying in all directions, for Como and Milan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The Venetians pursued the enemy, and showed themselves men of courage,
particularly their commander, sir Bartholomew d'Alviano and the son
of the count de Petigliano, who did wonders; but as he was attempting
to leap a wide ditch, his horse fell upon him,&mdash;and he was surrounded
and slain by the Swiss, for none were near enough to prevent them. The
lord d'Imbercourt was also killed fighting valiantly; he had rushed
among the ranks of the Swiss, like to an enraged wild boar, and was
of a most warlike nature, with the intrepidity of a lion, as many can
testify, who have seen him engaged on former occasions. Francis lord of
Bourbon was inclosed by the Swiss and put to death, his men not being
nigh to rescue him. The prince of Tallemont, the count de Sancerre, the
lord de Bussi, the captain Mouy, with a very great number of lords and
gentlemen of renown, whose courage had many times been displayed in
war, were killed at this battle.</p>

<p>During the engagement, neither baggage nor artillery were in danger
of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> taken, for they were excellently well defended by those who
ran as much risk as others engaged in the main battle. Many were well
mounted, so that, if fortune had been adverse, the poor adventurers
might have been able to support their friends, and have renewed the
fight.</p>

<p>The king made, this day, several new knights. During the conflict,
the cardinal of Sion fled, on seeing the quantities of dead,
under pretence, as he told Maximilian Sforza, of bringing back
reinforcements, but returned when too late.</p>

<p>In the course of this great butchery, a body of Swiss retreated toward
a cassino of the van-guard, where was posted the duke of Bourbon,
constable of France: he instantly pursued them, had the cassino set
on fire, and unless they could have flown through the flames, not one
could have escaped. May God have mercy on their souls, and of all those
who fell on this day! It is a great pity that it should be in the power
of two or three persons to cause the deaths of so many human creatures,
whom they seem to estimate no more than as so many sheep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> Alas! they
are not beasts, and have sense and reason, or at least ought to have,
although sometimes their strength fails through wicked intentions.</p>

<p>Some of the wounded Swiss fled to Milan, others to Como: those who
entered Milan told the citizens that they had gained the battle, on
which they were led to the great hospital to be cured,&mdash;but when the
Lansquenets afterwards entered that city, they finished to cure them in
a strange and terrible manner.</p>

<p>MILAN SURRENDERS TO THE KING OF FRANCE.&mdash;THE CASTLE, BESIEGED BY THE
FRENCH, SURRENDERS ON CAPITULATION.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after this victory, the townsmen of Milan waited on the king,
to beg his mercy and pardon for what they had done, and to present
him with the keys of their gates. The king mercifully received them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and forgave them, but not without making them pay a heavy fine. The
french army now marched to lay siege to the castle of Milan, into which
Maximilian Sforza with a body of Swiss, and others whom he collected,
had thrown themselves. The artillery made, within a few days, several
breaches in the outworks; and Pedro de Navarre had worked his mines
under the walls of the castle with such success great part of them fell
down.</p>

<p>Maximilian, perceiving himself in danger, made offers to capitulate,
when the king sent his chancellor with other gentlemen to treat with
him. They were all handsomely dressed: the chancellor had on a flowing
robe of raised cloth of gold. Having entered the castle, they instantly
began a negotiation with Maximilian for peace, and proceeded in it so
far that he accompanied them to the king's camp, where the treaty was
concluded, on condition that the Swiss in the castle should be allowed
to march away with their baggage in safety, and be paid the whole of
the money that had been promised them by the king of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Maximilian, by this treaty, resigned all pretensions to the duchy of
Milan<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to the king, who received him with kindness, and had him
escorted to France, where he was henceforth to reside. The king made a
brilliant entry into Milan, and staid there some time, during which he
was magnificently feasted by the nobles and gentlemen of the town and
duchy.</p>

<p>In regard to the inhabitants of Pavia, they escaped being pillaged from
their poverty, for all of the richer sort had retired into Milan so
soon as they heard of the king's successes,&mdash;and a treaty was concluded
with them by means of a sum of money.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>POPE LEO X. AND THE KING OF FRANCE MEET AT BOLOGNA, TO CONFER ON THE
STATE OF AFFAIRS.&mdash;THE KING RETURNS TO FRANCE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">About</span> this period died the commander of the venetian forces, the
lord Bartholomew d'Alviano. His death was caused by a fever, from
overheating himself. He was much regretted for his valour and his
attachment to the french interest. The Lansquenets received from the
king, at two different times, double pay. And during his residence at
Milan, a treaty was concluded by him with the Swiss-cantons, by means
of a large sum of money paid them, notwithstanding they had been so
lately conquered by the French.</p>

<p>When this treaty was signed, ambassadors were sent from the pope to
the king, to invite him to Bologna, that they might hold a conference
on the state of the affairs of Italy, and for the mutual strengthening
of their friendship and al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>liance. The king, in consequence, left
Milan with a numerous attendance, especially of men at arms, and
arrived at Bologna, where he had a welcome reception from the pope,
who entertained him handsomely,&mdash;and they had frequent and long
conversations together.</p>

<p>One day, the pope performed a solemn service in the cathedral, at which
the king assisted. It lasted some time; after which, an alliance was
concluded between them. The pope gave up to the king several towns
that belonged to him in right of the duchy of Milan. He gave also a
cardinal's hat to the bishop of Constance, brother to the grand master
of France.</p>

<p>When every thing had been concluded between the pope and the king, he
returned to Milan, and thence took the road to France, leaving the
duke of Bourbon, constable of France, his lieutenant-general of the
Milanese<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. He made all diligence in crossing the Alps, and arrived
at La Baûme, where the queen and his lady-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>mother were waiting for
him. He was joyfully received there, as well as in many other towns in
Provence. On leaving La Baûme, they all came together to Avignon, and
had a handsome entry. Thence they proceeded to Lyon, where the queen
made her public entry, and was received with all demonstrations of joy.</p>

<p>At this time died Ferdinand king of Arragon, who, during his reign,
had made many conquests, more especially over the Moors, whom he had
subjected to his obedience. At this period, also, died the magnificent
Lorenzo de Medici, brother to pope Leo X., who had lately married
a sister to the duke of Savoy, and sister also to the countess of
Angoulême, mother to Francis I. king of France. He had been
appointed generalissimo of the army of the church.</p>

<p>Nearly at this period, a furious battle was fought between the Sophi,
called Ishmael, and the grand Turk, and won by the latter, when more
than one hundred and sixty thousand men were slain<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> Sophi,
however, undismayed, collected fresh troops, and marched a considerable
army against the Turk, whom he, in his turn, defeated, and drove him
beyond the walls of Constantinople into Greece. The Sophi remained
in possession of all the conquered country, while the Turk was like
a captive within the territories of Christendom, and the war was
continued on both sides.</p>

<p>THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN ASSEMBLES A LARGE ARMY, TO ATTEMPT THE CONQUEST
OF THE MILANESE, AND TO DRIVE THE FRENCH OUT OF ITALY.&mdash;THE CONSTABLE
OF BOURBON, LIEUTENANT-GENERAL FOR THE KING IN ITALY, MARCHES AGAINST
HIM.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">While</span> the king of France was at Lyon, and toward the end of Lent,
in the year 1516, another war broke out in Italy, through the usual
manœuvres of the emperor Maximilian: he, at this time, was excited by
the angels of king Henry of England, which had not for a long time
flown in his country,&mdash;and by their means he subsidised the cantons of
Swisserland and the Grisons. He also urged the citizens of Milan to
revolt, principally through Galeas Visconti; and thinking every thing
in a good train, he marched toward Milan with a body of troops that he
had collected, under the brother of Maximilian Sforza, now resident in
France according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> treaty that had been concluded with him after
the battle of Marignano.</p>

<p>The emperor having, as I have said, assembled an army, marched it from
the plains of Verona to Lodi; but the constable, whom the king had
left, as his lieutenant, in the Milanese, hearing of this, collected
as many men together as the shortness of the time would allow, and
advanced to meet the enemy. His numbers were not great, on account
of this expedition of the emperor being unexpected, although he had
received hints of his intention, some seven weeks before, but he was
not certain of the truth.</p>

<p>The constable marched his army to the river Adda, and found the enemy
posted on the opposite bank. A short time prior to this, the king of
France had summoned some of the nobles of Milan to come to him, who
proceeded as far as Suza, to the number of thirty-seven, when they
held a consultation; and on the morrow, thirty-three of them fled to
join the emperor,&mdash;but the other four remained loyal to the French,
continued the road to Lyon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> and related to the king the shameful
conduct of the others.</p>

<p>To return to our subject; the duke of Bourbon, when on the Adda,
dispatched messengers to the Swiss-cantons, to hasten the troops the
king had agreed for,&mdash;and in consequence, about nine or ten thousand
infantry for the preservation of Milan, marched to Jurea. The duke
of Bourbon was preparing to attack the imperialists, when he heard
that Milan was on the point of a revolt; and as he had not sufficient
force to meet the army of the emperor with advantage, he was advised
to retreat to Milan, although he was himself most desirous to try the
event of a combat, and wait the coming of the Swiss, who remained very
long at Jurea.</p>

<p>The duke retreated with his army back to Milan with all diligence,
to the great surprise of the inhabitants: he immediately had strict
inquiries made after the authors of the intended revolt: several were
confined in prison, and many were beheaded. The other citizens, seeing
that the French were completely masters of their town, and that they
were not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> strongest, determined to suffer all extremities should
the French continue their ill treatment.</p>

<p>The emperor, when he heard of this sudden retreat of the French,
thought he had already conquered them, and, crossing the Adda, marched
his army toward Milan, and fixed his quarters near to Marignano.
You may easily imagine how much the burghers of Milan were now
alarmed,&mdash;for the constable had one of the suburbs burnt, to prevent
the enemy from fortifying it.</p>

<p>A few days after, the duke of Bourbon sent presents of cloths of gold,
and of silk, to the principal leaders of the Swiss, to hasten their
march, which had the desired effect,&mdash;and they soon appeared before the
castle, wherein they were joyfully received by the constable. He had
immediately Milan strengthened with ditches and outworks, so that it
was much stronger than ever. The emperor advanced with his army, now
very numerous, before the walls, and saluted them with a large train
of artillery, which was as boldly returned from the ramparts by the
garrison.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN, FINDING THAT HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN HIS
ATTEMPT ON MILAN, MARCHES AWAY.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> emperor was much surprised that his army should be in the utmost
distress for provision, as he expected that Milan would have opened
its gates on his appearing before them, according to the promises he
had received from Galeas Visconti: but just the contrary happened;
and as he had heard of the reinforcements the French had obtained,
and felt how much his own army suffered from want of provision, and
also that he had now no great quantity of english angels, he retreated
toward Bergamo, and summoned that town to surrender. The inhabitants,
perceiving that no succours could be expected from Milan, raised a
sum of money among themselves, and offered it to the emperor, on his
marching away. He thence retreated toward Lodi, plundered and burnt
great part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> town, and put to death many of the inhabitants,
which was a great pity.</p>

<p>The duke of Bourbon followed close on the rear of the emperor's army,
when skirmishes frequently happened, to the loss of the imperialists
in killed and wounded. Maximilian, finding his situation become
disagreeable, went away under pretence that the death of the king of
Hungary was the cause of his sudden departure, leaving his army in a
very doubtful state, which then was broken up, and the men retreated to
their homes.</p>

<p>The emperor, however, pocketed fifty thousand angels the king of
England had sent to his aid, thinking that he was in the quiet
possession of the Milanese,&mdash;but he was far enough from it.</p>

<p>About this time, the king of France sent some of the gentlemen of his
bedchamber to assist the duke of Bourbon in managing the affairs of the
Milanese.</p>

<p>THE KING OF FRANCE GOES ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY
HANDKERCHIEF IN CHAMBERY.&mdash;A TREATY OF PEACE CONCLUDED BETWEEN HIM AND
THE ARCHDUKE KING OF SPAIN.</p></blockquote>


<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">About</span> Whitsuntide, in this year of 1516, the king of France departed
from Lyon, accompanied by many gentlemen, to fulfil a vow he had made
of a pilgrimage to the church of the Holy Handkerchief in Chambery. As
he had vowed to perform it on foot, he set out accordingly, with his
train of attendants. They formed a handsome spectacle; for they were
all splendidly dressed in fancy habiliments, decorated with plenty of
feathers. Thus they followed the king on foot as far as Chambery, where
he met the duke of Bourbon on his return from Italy. This meeting gave
much joy to both,&mdash;and the king was entertained at Chambery, during his
stay there, by the duke of Savoy.</p>

<p>At this time, a treaty was concluded between the Spaniards and the
garrison in the castle of Brescia, who marched away with their arms
and baggage. The Venetians, to whom the place belonged, immediately
took possession of the town and castle, conformably to an agreement
made with the late king of France, Louis XII. Somewhat prior to
this, several counts in Germany collected bodies of men, and entered
Lorraine, where they committed much mischief. The cause of this warfare
was a claim the Lansquenets made on certain mines in that country, on
the borders of Germany, which they attempted to gain; but the duke of
Lorraine repulsed them, and nothing more was done. These counts waited
afterwards on the king of France, at Tours, and were presented to him
by the lord de Florenge, son to the captain de la Marche.</p>

<p>On the king's return from Savoy, he went into Touraine. About this
time, the king of Navarre died: he was son to the lord d'Albret, and
had been driven out of his kingdom by Ferdinand the Catholic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> as has
been before mentioned. A treaty of peace was now concluded between the
king of France and the archduke king of Spain, which was proclaimed at
Paris and throughout the realm. One of the conditions was, that the
king of Spain should marry the princess Louisa, only daughter to the
king of France.</p>

<p>A conference on the subject of peace was holden at Noyon. The
commissioners from the king of France were, the grand master, the
bishop of Paris, the president Olivier, and others,&mdash;and the great
lords of Flanders and of Spain, on the part of the king of Spain. The
lord de Ravenstein was afterwards sent by him, as his ambassador to the
king of France, grandly accompanied by the barons of Picardy.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 6th day of October, in the before-mentioned year, the
king arrived in his good city of Paris, where he was received with the
usual demonstrations of joy. On the morrow, he departed for the abbey
of St Denis, in order to replace the saints in their shrines, which,
at his request, had been taken down for the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> welfare of his
realm, and to return them his humble thanks for the great victory he
had obtained through their means and intercessions. This was the usual
custom for the kings of France to perform, in person, on their return
from foreign wars.</p>

<p class="ph2">NOTES AND EMENDATIONS.</p>


<p>Page 6. line 12. <i>Lord de Guise.</i>] Claude, second son of René the
second, duke of Lorraine, was ancestor of the dukes of Guise. He died
in 1550 and therefore must have been very young at this period.</p>

<p>Page 6. line 5. from the bottom. <i>Melfy. Q. Amelfi?</i>] Mary, natural
daughter of king Ferdinand, married to Anthony, duke of Amelfi, of the
house of Piccolomini.</p>

<p>Page 16. line 15. <i>Lord de Luxembourg.</i>] See note p. 108.</p>

<p>Page 24. line 7 from the bottom. <i>Marquis of Mantua.</i>] Francis III.
fourth marquis of Mantua, of the house of Gonzaga.</p>

<p>Page 24. line 3 from the bottom. <i>Lord of Ferrara.</i>] Hercules d'Este,
first duke of Modena.</p>

<p>Page 29. line 13. <i>Bastard of Bourbon.</i>] Matthew lord of Roche, eldest
of the bastards of John II. duke of Bourbon.</p>

<p>Page 31. line 4 from the bottom. <i>Prince.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> His surviving children
were 1. Charles first duke of Vendôme, the father (by Frances de
Longueville duchess of Beaumont) of Anthony king of Navarre. 2. Louis,
cardinal of Vendôme. 3. Anthonia, wife of Claude duke of Guise. 4.
Louisa abbess of Fontevraud. 5. Francis, lord of St Pol, a title which
he inherited from his mother the eldest daughter of Peter, son of
the constable. See vol. xi. page 213. note.</p>

<p>Page 35. line 4 from the bottom. <i>Died.</i>] Prince John, to whom the
unfortunate Margaret of Austria was betrothed after her rejection by
Charles the eighth.</p>

<p>Page 35. line 3 from the bottom. <i>Duke of Savoy.</i>] Charles John
Amadeus, commonly called Charles the second, duke of Savoy, died this
year at the tender age of eight years. The suspicion of poisoning the
waters, which is no where that I can find alluded to by Guicciardini,
probably refers to his successor Philip count of Bresse who died the
year following just at the time that he had intended to leave the party
of the king of France and embrace that of the confederates. Philip had
three sons; Philibert II. who succeeded him and died in 1504 without
issue by Margaret of Austria his wife; Charles III; and Philip duke
of Nemours. Louisa, who married Charles count of Angoulême, and is so
celebrated in history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> as the mother of Francis the first, was one of
his daughters.</p>

<p>Page 38. line 10. <i>Lord of Montpensier.</i>] This prince, by his wife
Clara Gonzaga, left issue, 1. Louis count of Montpensier who died in
1501, 2. Charles, who married Susanna daughter and heiress of Peter II.
duke of Bourbon, was made constable of France in 1515, was afterwards
condemned for treason, and was killed in the imperial service at the
siege of Rome in 1527, 3. Francis duke of Chatelherault, died 1515;
4. Louisa, lady of Chavigny, 5. Reparata, married to Anthony duke of
Lorraine. Neither of the sons left any issue surviving.</p>

<p>Page 39. line 7. <i>Soul.</i>] See Philip de Comines, whose most valuable
memoirs conclude with this event.</p>

<p>Page 39. line 8. from the bottom. <i>Lord John Peraule.</i>] Raymond
Perault, bishop of Saintes, Cardinal in 1493, died in 1505.</p>

<p>Page 46. line 4 from the bottom. <i>Count Gayache.</i>] Qu. Count of
Cajazzo? He was of the family of the San Severini, and connected by
marriage with the house of Sforza, but not, that I can find, with that
of Visconti.</p>

<p>Page 87. line 9. <i>Lord Peter of Bourbon.</i>] Peter II. duke of
Bourbon, the last of the eldest line of Robert de Clermont son of
St. Louis. His only daughter and heir, Susanna, married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> Charles de
Bourbon-Montpensier, afterwards constable of France and duke of Bourbon.</p>

<p>Page 97. line 3. from the bottom. <i>Wife.</i>] Eleanor, countess of Ligny
princess of Altamura, duchess of Venosa, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Page 100. line 15. <i>Brother.</i>] Charles III. surnamed the good. Their
younger brother was Philip, who married Charlotte, daughter of Louis,
duke of Longueville, and was created duke of Nemours.</p>

<p>Page 100. line 17. <i>Duchess of Berry.</i>] Jane daughter of Louis XI. the
repudiated wife of Louis XII. who after her divorce was called duchess
of Berry.</p>

<p>Page 103. line 4. <i>Lord of Foix.</i>] Germaine de Foix, daughter of John
viscount de Narbonne. See note to vol. x. p. 187.</p>

<p>Page 105. line 12. 1506.] Leaving issue, by Joanna daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella, 1. Charles, afterwards emperor, and king of
Spain, 2. Eleanor, the wife, first, of Emanuel king of Portugal, 2ndly
of Francis the first, 3. Isabella, the wife of Christian the second
king of Denmark; 4. Ferdinand, King of Hungary, and emperor of Germany
after the death of his brother; 5. Mary, the wife of Lewis the second
king of Hungary; 6. Catherine, the wife of John the third king of
Portugal.</p>

<p>Page 105. line 14. <i>August.</i>] Anne the wife of Uladislaus king of
Bohemia, who succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> to the crown of Hungary on the death of
Matthias Corvinus in 1490. By this marriage she had Lewis, afterwards
king of Hungary, and Anne the wife of Ferdinand of Austria, in whose
right he became king of Hungary on the death of Lewis in 1526 without
issue.</p>

<p>Page 106. line 13. <i>John de Bentivoglio.</i>] John the second of the
name, son of Hannibal, and grandson of John, who made himself master
of Bologna in 1400. See the historians of Bologna, especially the
"historie memorabili" of Gasparo Bombaci who is by far the most
interesting of these writers.</p>

<p>Page 108. line 13. <i>Trivulces.</i>]</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;"<i>La nudrita Damigella Trivulzia</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>al sacro speco</i>".</span><br />
</p>

<p>She was the daughter of Giovanni Trivulzio and Angela di Martinengo,
and is celebrated equally by the historians and poets of the age.</p>

<p>Page 120. line 11 from the bottom. <i>King.</i>] She was married to Hercules
the second, duke of Ferrara, and died in 1575.</p>

<p>Page 132. line 4. <i>Pedro de Navarre.</i>] Pedro Navarro, a great commander
in the Spanish army.</p>

<p>Page 132. line 5. <i>Marquis of Pescara.</i>] Ferdinand d'Avalos, Marquis of
Pescara.</p>

<p>Page 132. line 8. <i>Betonde.</i>] Betonde&mdash;Bitonto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Page 132. line 12. <i>Viceroy of Naples.</i>] Don Raymond de Cardona.</p>

<p>Page 132. line 15. <i>Marquis de la Padulla.</i>] Della Palude. See
Guicciardini Lib. 10. for an account of this great battle.</p>

<p>Page 132. last line. <i>Utrecht.</i>] More probably Trajetto, Vespasian the
son of Prospero Colonna was called duke of Trajetto, and though I do
not find his name among those present at the battle of Ravenna, it is
not unlikely that he was there under his relation Fabricio Colonna,
duke of Palliano who commanded the Italian forces.</p>

<p>Page 151. line 3 from the bottom. <i>Duke of Valois.</i>] Francis count
d'Angoulesme the presumptive heir to the crown of France, had lately
been honoured with this title.</p>

<p>Page 164. line 5 from the bottom. <i>Brittany.</i>] Francis was duke of
Brittany in right of the princess Claude who succeeded to that duchy
on the death of her mother queen Anne. For, although the two crowns,
the royal and ducal, had been united in the person of Louis XII, yet
the duchy remained distinct from the kingdom, and would have passed
away from it again had the princess Claude not married the heir of the
crown of France. The countries were not incorporated till the reign of
Francis I. who procured an act of union and settlement to be passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Page 167. line 2. <i>Lord of Alençon.</i>] Charles the second duke of
Alençon, son of René and grandson of John II. who was beheaded. He
married Margaret the sister of Francis the first, afterwards wife of
Henry d'Albret king of Navarre.</p>

<p>Page 167. line 3. <i>Lord of Bourbon.</i>] Charles duke of Bourbon mentioned
before.</p>

<p>Page 167. line 3. <i>Lord of Vendôme.</i>] Charles duke of Vendôme and
Francis lord of St Pol, both mentioned before.</p>

<p>Page 167. line 4. <i>Louis de Nevers.</i>] Count of Auxerre, 2d son of
Engilbert of Cleves count of Nevers who died in 1506.</p>

<p>Page 167. line 10. <i>Madame de Nevers.</i>] Mary d'Albret, the wife of
Charles Count of Nevers eldest son of Engilbert of Cleves.</p>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
